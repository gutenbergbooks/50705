<p class="h2">THE DE BERCY AFFAIR</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br/>
SOME PHASES OF THE PROBLEM</h2>

<p>CHIEF INSPECTOR WINTER sat in his
private office at New Scotland Yard, while
a constable in uniform, bare-headed, stood
near the door in the alert attitude of one who awaits
the nod of a superior. Nevertheless, Mr. Winter,
half-turning from a desk littered with documents,
eyed the man as though he had just said something
outrageous, something so opposed to the tenets of
the Police Manual that the Chief Commissioner alone
could deal with the offense.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you been to Mr. Furneaux&#39;s residence?&quot;
he snapped, nibbling one end of a mustache already
clipped or chewed so short that his strong white
teeth could barely seize one refractory bristle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you telephoned to any of the district stations?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, sir&mdash;to Vine Street, Marlborough
Street, Cannon Row, Tottenham Court Road, and
half-a-dozen others.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg&nbsp;2]</span>
&quot;No news of Mr. Furneaux anywhere? The
earth must have opened and swallowed him!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The station-sergeant at Finchley Road thought
he saw Mr. Furneaux jump on to a &#39;bus at St.
John&#39;s Wood about six o&#39;clock yesterday evening,
sir; but he could not be sure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, he wouldn&#39;t. I know that station-sergeant.
He is a fat-head.... When did you telegraph
to Kenterstone?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At 6.30, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Winter whisked a pink telegraphic slip from
off the blotting-pad, and read:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Inspector Furneaux not here to my knowledge.</span><br />
<span class="i2"><i>Police Superintendent</i>, <span class="smcap">Kenterstone</span>.</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Another legal quibbler&mdash;fat, too, I&#39;ll be bound,&quot;
he growled. Then he laughed a little in a vein of
irritated perplexity, and said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you, Johnson. You, at least, seem to
have done everything possible. Try again in the
morning. I <i>must</i> see Mr. Furneaux at the earliest
moment! Kindly bring me the latest editions of
the evening papers, and, by the way, help yourself
to a cigar.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The gift of a cigar was a sign of the great man&#39;s
favor, and it was always an extraordinarily good one,
of which none but himself knew the exact brand.
Left alone for a few minutes, he glanced through
a written telephone message which he had thrust
under the blotting-pad when Police Constable Johnson
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg&nbsp;3]</span>
had entered. It was from Paris, and announced
that two notorious Anarchists were en route to England
by the afternoon train, due at Charing Cross
at 9.15 p.m.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anarchists!&quot; growled the Chief Inspector&mdash;&quot;Pooh!
Antoine Descartes and Émile Janoc&mdash;Soho
for them&mdash;absinthe and French cigarettes&mdash;green
and black poison. Poor devils! they will do themselves
more harm than his Imperial Majesty. Now,
where the deuce <i>is</i> Furneaux? This Feldisham
Mansions affair is just in his line&mdash;Clarke will ruin
it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Johnson came back with a batch of evening
papers. Understanding his duties&mdash;above all, understanding
Mr. Winter&mdash;he placed them on the
table, saluted, and withdrew without a word. Soon
the floor was littered with discarded news-sheets,
those quick-moving eyes ever seeking one definite
item&mdash;&quot;The Murder in the West End&mdash;Latest&quot;&mdash;or
some such headline, and once only was his attention
held by a double-leaded paragraph at the top
of a column:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">A correspondent writes:&mdash;&quot;I saw the deceased lady in company
with a certain popular American millionaire at the
International Horse Show in June, and was struck by her
remarkable resemblance to a girl of great beauty resident in
Jersey some eight years ago. The then village maid was
elected Rose Queen at a rural fête, I photographed her, and
comparison of the photograph with the portrait of
Mademoiselle de Bercy exhibited in this year&#39;s Academy
served to confirm me in my opinion that she and the Jersey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
Rose Queen were one and the same person. I may add that
my accidental discovery was made long before the commission
of the shocking crime of yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Under present circumstances, of course, we withhold from
publication the name of the Jersey Rose Queen, but the line
of inquiry thus indicated may prove illuminative should
there be any doubt as to the earlier history of the hapless
lady whose lively wit and personal charm have brought London
society to her feet since she left the Paris stage last year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Winter did not hurry. Tucking the cigar comfortably
into a corner of his mouth, he read each
sentence with a quiet deliberation; then he sought
a telephone number among the editorial announcements,
and soon was speaking into a transmitter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that the <i>Daily Gazette</i>?... Put me on
to the editorial department, please.... That
you, Arbuthnot? Well, I&#39;m Winter, of Scotland
Yard. Your evening edition, referring to the Feldisham
Mansions tragedy, contains an item....
Oh, you expected to hear from me, did you? Well,
what is the lady&#39;s name, and who is your correspondent?...
What? Spell it. A-r-m-a-u-d. All
right; if you feel you <i>must</i> write to the man first,
save time by asking him to send me the photograph.
I will pass it on to you exclusively, of course.
Thanks. Good-by.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Before the receiver was on its hook, the Chief
Inspector was taking a notebook from his breast
pocket, and he made the following entry:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Mirabel Armaud, Rose Queen, village near St. Heliers,
summer of 1900.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
A knock sounded on the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, if this could only be Furneaux!&quot; groaned
Winter. &quot;Come in! Ah! Glad to see you, Mr.
Clarke. I was hoping you would turn up. Any
news?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing much, sir&mdash;that is to say, nothing
really definite. The maid-servant is still delirious,
and keeps on screaming out that Mr. Osborne killed
her mistress. I am beginning to believe there is
something in it&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter&#39;s prominent steel blue eyes dwelt on Clarke
musingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But haven&#39;t we the clearest testimony as to
Osborne&#39;s movements?&quot; he asked. &quot;He quitted
Miss de Bercy&#39;s flat at 6.25, drove in his motor
to the Ritz, attended a committee meeting of the
International Polo Club at 6.30, occupied the chair,
dined with the committee, and they all went to the
Empire at nine o&#39;clock. Unless a chauffeur, a hall-porter,
a head-waiter, two under-waiters, five polo
celebrities, a box-office clerk, and several other persons,
are mixed up in an amazing conspiracy to
shield Mr. Rupert Osborne, he certainly could not
have murdered a woman who was alive in Feldisham
Mansions at half-past seven.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Clarke pursed his lips sagely. As a study in
opposites, no two men could manifest more contrasts.
Clarke might have had the words &quot;Detective
Inspector&quot; branded on his forehead: his
features sharp, cadaverous, eyes deep-set and suspicious,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
his nose and chin inquisitive, his lips fixed
as a rat-trap. Wide cheek-bones, low-placed ears,
and narrow brows gave him a sinister aspect. In
his own special department, the hunting out of &quot;confidence
men,&quot; card-sharpers, and similar hawklike
pluckers of the provincial pigeon fluttering through
London&#39;s streets, he was unrivaled. But Winter
more resembled an intellectual prizefighter than the
typical detective of fiction. His round head, cropped
hair, wide-open eyes, joined to a powerful physique
and singular alertness of glance and movement, suggested
that he varied the healthy monotony of a
gentleman farmer&#39;s life by attendance at the National
Sporting Club and other haunts of pugilism.
A terror to wrongdoers, he was never disliked by
them, whereas Clarke was hated. In a word, Winter
was a sharp brain, Clarke a sharp nose, and that
is why Winter groaned inwardly at being compelled
to intrust the Feldisham Mansions crime to Clarke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is your theory of this affair?&quot; he said,
rather by way of making conversation than from
any hope of being enlightened.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is simple enough,&quot; said Clarke, his solemn
glance resting for a moment on the box of cigars.
Winter nodded in the same direction. His cigars
were sometimes burnt offerings as well as rewards.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Light up,&quot; he said, &quot;and tell me what you
think.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mademoiselle de Bercy was killed by either a
disappointed lover or a discarded husband. All these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
foreign actresses marry early, but grow tired of
matrimony within a year. If, then, there is no
chance of upsetting Mr. Osborne&#39;s alibi, we must
get the Paris police to look into Miss de Bercy&#39;s
history. Her husband will probably turn out to
be some third-rate actor or broken-down manager.
Let us find <i>him</i>, and see if <i>he</i> is as sure of his whereabouts
last evening as Mr. Rupert Osborne professes
to be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You seem to harp on Osborne&#39;s connection with
the affair?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And why not, sir? A man like him, with all his
money, ought to know better than to go gadding
about with actresses.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But he is interested in the theater&mdash;he is quite
an authority on French comedy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He can tackle French tragedy now&mdash;he is up
to the neck in this one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You still cling to the shrieking housemaid&mdash;to
her ravings, I mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps I should have mentioned it sooner, sir,
but I have come across a taxicab driver who picked
up a gentleman uncommonly like Mr. Osborne at
7.20 p.m. on Tuesday, and drove him from the corner
of Berkeley Street to Knightsbridge, waited
there nearly fifteen minutes, and brought him back
again to Berkeley Street.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Chief Inspector came as near being startled
as is permissible in Scotland Yard.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is a very serious statement,&quot; he said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
quietly, wheeling round in his chair and scrutinizing
his subordinate&#39;s lean face with eyes more wide-open
than ever, if that were possible. &quot;It is tantamount
to saying that some person resembling Mr. Osborne
hired a cab outside the Ritz Hotel, was taken to
Feldisham Mansions at the very hour Miss de Bercy
was murdered, and returned to the Ritz in the same
vehicle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Exactly so,&quot; and Clarke pursed his thin lips
meaningly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So, then, you <i>have</i> discovered something?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Winter&#39;s tone had suddenly become dryly
official, and the other man, fearing a reprimand,
added:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I admit, sir, I ought to have told you sooner,
but I don&#39;t want to make too much of the incident.
The taxicab chauffeur does not know Mr. Rupert
Osborne by sight, and I took good care not to mention
the name. The unknown was dressed like Mr.
Osborne, and looked like him&mdash;that is all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is the driver?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;William Campbell&mdash;cab number X L 4001. I
have hired him to-morrow morning from ten o&#39;clock,
and then he will have an opportunity of seeing Mr.
Osborne&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Meet me here at 9.30, and I will keep the appointment
for you. Until&mdash;until I make other arrangements,
I intend to take this Feldisham Mansions
affair into my own hands. Of course, I should
have been delighted to leave it in your charge, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
during the past hour something of vastly greater
importance has turned up, and I want you to tackle
it immediately.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Something more important than a society murder?&quot;
Clarke could not help saying.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. You know that the Tsar comes to London
from Windsor to-morrow? Well, read this,&quot; and
Winter, with the impressive air of one who communicates
a state secret, handed the Paris message.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; muttered Clarke, gloating over the word
&quot;Anarchists.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now you understand,&quot; murmured Winter
darkly. &quot;Unfortunately these men are far too well
acquainted with me to render it advisable that I
should shadow them. So I shall accompany you to
Charing Cross, point them out, and leave them to
you. A live monarch is of more account than a
dead actress, so you see now what confidence I have
in you, Mr. Clarke.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Clarke&#39;s sallow cheeks flushed a little. Winter
might be a genial chief, but he seldom praised so
openly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I quite recognize that, sir,&quot; he said. &quot;Of
course, I am sorry to drop out of this murder case.
It has points, first-rate points. I haven&#39;t told you
yet about the stone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why&mdash;what stone?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The stone that did for Miss de Bercy. The
flat was not thoroughly searched last night, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
this morning I examined every inch of it, and under
the piano I found&mdash;this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He produced from a pocket something wrapped
in a handkerchief. Unfolding the linen, he rose and
placed on the blotting-pad, under the strong light
of a shaded lamp, one of those flat stones which
the archeologist calls &quot;celts,&quot; or &quot;flint ax-heads.&quot;
Indeed, no expert eye was needed to determine its
character. The cutting edge formed a perfect
curve; two deep indentations showed how it had been
bound on to a handle of bone or wood. At the
broadest part it measured fully four inches, its
length the same, thickness about three-quarters of
an inch. That it was a genuine neolithic flint could
not be questioned. A modern lapidary might contrive
to chip a flint into the same shape, but could
not impart that curious bloom which apparently exudes
from the heart of the stone during its thousands
of centuries of rest in prehistoric cave or
village mound. This specimen showed the gloss of
antiquity on each smooth facet.</p>

<p class="indent">But it showed more. When used in war or the
chase by the fearsome being who first fashioned it
to serve his savage needs, it must often have borne
a grisly tint, and now <i>again</i> each side of the
strangely sharp edge was smeared with grewsome
daubs, while some black hairs clung to the
dried clots which clustered on the irregular surfaces.</p>

<p class="indent">Sentiment finds little room in the retreat of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
Chief Inspector, so Winter whistled softly when he
set eyes on this weird token of a crime.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By gad!&quot; he cried, &quot;in my time at the Yard
I&#39;ve seen many queer instruments of butchery&mdash;ranging
from a crusader&#39;s mace to the strings of a bass
fiddle&mdash;but this beats the lot.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It must have come out of some museum,&quot; said
the other.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It suggests a tragedy of the British Association,&quot;
mused Winter aloud.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It ought to supply a first-rate clew, anyhow,&quot;
said Clarke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, it does; it must. If only&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter checked himself on the very lip of indiscretion,
for Clarke detested Furneaux. He consulted
his watch.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We must be off now,&quot; he said briskly. &quot;Leave
the stone with me, and while we are walking to Charing
Cross I can give you a few pointers about these
Anarchist pests. Once they are comfortably boxed
up in some café in Old Compton Street you can come
away safely for the night, and pick them up again
about midday to-morrow. They are absolutely
harm&mdash;I mean they cannot do any harm until the
Tsar arrives. From that moment you must stick
to them like a limpet to a rock; I will arrange for
a man to relieve you in the evening, nor shall I forget
to give your name to the Embassy people when they
begin to scatter diamond pins around.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When he meant to act a part, Winter was an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
excellent comedian, and soon Clarke was prowling
at the heels of those redoubtables, Antoine Descartes
and Émile Janoc.</p>

<p class="indent">Once Clarke was safely shelved, Winter called the
first taxicab he met and was driven to Feldisham
Mansions. An unerring instinct had warned him
at once that the murder of the actress was no ordinary
crime; but Clarke had happened to be on duty
when the report of it reached the Yard a few minutes
after eight o&#39;clock the previous evening, and
Winter had bewailed the mischance which deprived
him of the services of Furneaux, the one man to
whom he could have left the inquiry with confidence.</p>

<p class="indent">The very simplicity of the affair was baffling.
Mademoiselle Rose de Bercy was the leading lady in
a company of artistes, largely recruited from the
Comédie Française, which had played a short season
in London during September of the past year. She
did not accompany the others when they returned
to Paris, but remained, to become a popular figure
in London society, and was soon in great demand
for her <i>contes drôles</i> at private parties. She was
now often to be seen in the company of Mr. Rupert
Osborne, a young American millionaire, whose tastes
ordinarily followed a less frivolous bent than he
showed in seeking the society of an undeniably chic
and sprightly Frenchwoman. It had been rumored
that the two would be married before the close of
the summer, and color was lent to the statement by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
the lady&#39;s withdrawal from professional engagements.</p>

<p class="indent">So far as Winter&#39;s information went, this was
the position of affairs until a quarter to eight on
the night of the first Tuesday in July. At that
hour, Mademoiselle de Bercy&#39;s housemaid either entered
or peered into her mistress&#39;s drawing-room,
and saw her lifeless body stretched on the floor.
Shrieking, the girl fled out into the lobby and down
a flight of stairs to the hall-porter&#39;s little office,
which adjoined the elevator. By chance, the man
had just collected the letters from the boxes on each
of the six floors of the block of flats, and had gone
to the post; Mademoiselle de Bercy&#39;s personal maid
and her cook, having obtained permission to visit an
open-air exhibition, had, it seemed, been absent since
six o&#39;clock; the opposite flat on the same story was
closed, the tenants being at the seaside; and the
distraught housemaid, pursued by phantoms, forthwith
yielded to the strain, so that the hall-porter,
on his return, found her lying across the threshold
of his den.</p>

<p class="indent">He summoned his wife from the basement, and
the frenzied girl soon regained a partial consciousness.
It was difficult to understand her broken
words, but, such as they were, they sent the man
in hot haste to the flat on the first floor. The outer
and inner doors were wide open, as was the door
of the drawing-room, and sufficient daylight
streamed in through two lofty windows to reveal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
something of the horror that had robbed the housemaid
of her wits.</p>

<p class="indent">The unfortunate Frenchwoman was lying on her
back in the center of the room, and the hall-porter&#39;s
hurried scrutiny found that she had been done to
death with a brutal ferocity, her face almost unrecognizable.</p>

<p class="indent">Not until the return of the French maid, Pauline,
from the exhibition, could it be determined beyond
doubt that robbery was not the motive of the crime,
for she was able to assure the police that her mistress&#39;s
jewels were untouched. A gold purse was
found on a table close to the body, a bracelet
sparkled on a wrist cruelly bruised, and a brooch
fastened at the neck the loose wrap worn as a preliminary
to dressing for the evening.</p>

<p class="indent">Owing to the breakdown of the only servant actually
present in the flat at the time of the murder,
it was impossible to learn anything intelligible beyond
the girl&#39;s raving cry that &quot;Mr. Osborne did
it.&quot; Still, there was apparently little difficulty in
realizing what had happened. The housemaid had
been startled while at supper, either by a shriek or
some noise of moving furniture, had gone to the
drawing-room, given one glance at the terrifying
spectacle that met her eyes, and was straightway
bereft of her wits.</p>

<p class="indent">The Chief Inspector was turning over in his mind
the puzzling features of the affair when his automobile
swept swiftly out of the traffic and glare of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
Knightsbridge into the quiet street in which stood
Feldisham Mansions. A policeman had just strolled
along the pavement to disperse a group of curious
people gathered near the entrance, so Winter
stopped his cab at a little distance and alighted unobserved.</p>

<p class="indent">He walked rapidly inside and found the hall-porter
at his post. When the man learnt the visitor&#39;s
identity he seemed surprised.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Clarke has bin here all day, sir,&quot; he said,
&quot;and, as soon as he left, another gentleman kem,
though I must say he hasn&#39;t bothered <i>me</i> much&mdash;&mdash;&quot;
this with a touch of resentment, for the hall-porter&#39;s
self-importance was enhanced by his connection with
the tragedy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Another gentleman!&quot;&mdash;this was incomprehensible,
since Clarke would surely place a constable in
charge of the flat. &quot;What name did he give?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s up there at this minnit, sir, an&#39; here&#39;s his
card.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter read: &quot;Mr. Charles Furneaux, Criminal
Investigation Department, Scotland Yard.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I&#39;m jiggered!&quot; he muttered, and he added
fuel to the fire of the hall-porter&#39;s annoyance by
disregarding the elevator and rushing up the stairs,
three steps at a time.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br/>
DARKNESS</h2>

<p class="indent">Winter felt at once relieved and displeased.
Twice during the hour had his authority been disregarded.
He was willing to ignore Clarke&#39;s
method of doling out important facts because such
was the man&#39;s secretive nature. But Furneaux!
The urgent messages sent to every place where they
might reach him, each and all summoned him to Scotland
Yard without the slightest reference to the
Feldisham Mansions crime. It was with a stiff
upper lip, therefore, that the Chief Inspector acknowledged
the salute of the constable who admitted
him to the ill-fated Frenchwoman&#39;s abode. Furneaux
was his friend, Furneaux might be admirable,
Furneaux was the right man in the right place, but
Furneaux must first receive an official reminder of
the claims of discipline.</p>

<p class="indent">The subdued electric lights in the hall revealed
within a vista of Oriental color blended with Western
ideals of comfort. Two exquisitely fashioned
lamps of hammered iron, rifled from a Pekin temple,
softened by their dragons and lotus leaves the glare
of the high-powered globes within them. Praying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
carpets, frayed by the deserts of Araby, covered
the geometric design of a parquet floor, and bright-hued
draperies of Mirzapur hid the rigid outlines
of British carpentry. A perfume of joss-sticks still
clung to the air: it suggested the apartments of
a Sultana rather than the bower of a fashionable
lady in the West End of London.</p>

<p class="indent">First impressions are powerful, and Winter acknowledged
the spell of the unusual here, but his
impassive face showed no sign of this when he asked
the constable the whereabouts of Mr. Furneaux.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In there, sir,&quot; said the man, pointing to a door.</p>

<p class="indent">Winter noted instantly that the floor creaked beneath
his light tread. The rugs deadened his footsteps,
but the parquetry complained of his weight.
It was, he perceived, almost impossible for anyone
to traverse an old flooring of that type without
revealing the fact to ordinarily acute ears. Once
when his heel fell on the bare wood, it rang with
a sharp yet hollow note. It seemed, somehow, that
the place was empty&mdash;that it missed its presiding
spirit.</p>

<p class="indent">Oddly enough, as he remembered afterwards, he
hesitated with outstretched hand in front of the
closed door. He was doubtful whether or not to
knock. As a matter of fact, he did tap slightly on
a panel before turning the handle. Then he received
his second vague impression of a new and
strange element in the history of a crime. The
room was in complete darkness.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
Though Winter never admitted the existence of
nerves, he did not even try to conceal from his own
consciousness that he started distinctly when he
looked into a blackness rendered all the more striking
by the glimpse of a few feet of floor revealed by
the off-shine from the hall-light.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you here, Furneaux?&quot; he forced himself
to say quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, that you, Winter!&quot; came a voice from the
interior. &quot;Yes, I was dreaming in the dusk, I
think. Let me give you a light.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dusk, you call it? Gad, it&#39;s like a vault!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter&#39;s right hand had found the electric
switches, and two clusters of lamps on wall-brackets
leaped alight. Furneaux was standing, his hands
behind his back, almost in the center, but the Chief
Inspector gathered that the room&#39;s silent occupant
had been seated in a corner farthest removed from
the windows, and that his head had been propped
on his clenched hands, for the dull red marks of his
knuckles were still visible on both cheeks.</p>

<p class="indent">Each was aware of a whiff of surprise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Queer trick, sitting in the dark,&quot; Furneaux remarked,
his eyes on the floor. &quot;I&mdash;find I collect
my wits better that way&mdash;sometimes. Sometimes,
one cannot have light enough: for instance, the moment
I saw fear in Lady Holt&#39;s face I knew that
her diamonds had been stolen by herself&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter reflected that light was equally unkind
to Furneaux as to &quot;Lady Holt,&quot; for the dapper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
little man looked pallid and ill at ease in this flood
of electric brilliancy.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a silence. Then Furneaux volunteered
the remark: &quot;In this instance, thought is needed,
not observation. One might gaze at that for twenty
years, but it would not reveal the cause of Mademoiselle
de Bercy&#39;s murder.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>That</i>&quot; was a dark stain near the center of the
golden-brown carpet. Winter bent a professional
eye on it, but his mind was assimilating two new
ideas. In the first place, Furneaux was not the
cheery colleague whose perky chatterings were his
most deadly weapons when lulling a rogue into fancied
security. In the second, he himself had not
been prepared for the transit from a hall of Eastern
gorgeousness to a room fastidiously correct in its
reproduction of the period labeled by connoisseurs
&quot;after Louis XV.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The moment was not ripe for an inquiry anent
Furneaux&#39;s object in hastening to Feldisham Mansions
without first reporting himself. Winter somehow
felt that the question would jar just then and
there, and though not forgotten, it was waived;
still, there was a hint of it in his next comment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must confess I am glad to find you here,&quot;
he said. &quot;Clarke has cleared the ground somewhat,
but&mdash;er&mdash;he has a heavy hand, and I have turned
him on to a new job&mdash;Anarchists.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He half expected an answering gleam of fun in
the dark eyes lifted to his, for these two were close
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
friends at all seasons; but Furneaux seemed not
even to hear! His lips muttered:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;wonder.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wonder what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What purpose could be served by this girl&#39;s
death. Who bore her such a bitter grudge that not
even her death would sate their hatred, but they
must try also to destroy her beauty?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Now, the Chief Inspector had learnt that everyone
who had seen the dead woman expressed this
same sentiment, yet it came unexpectedly from Furneaux&#39;s
lips; because Furneaux never said the obvious
thing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Clarke believes,&quot;&mdash;Winter loathed the necessity
for this constant reference to Clarke&mdash;&quot;Clarke believes
that she was killed by one of two people, either
a jealous husband or a dissatisfied lover.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As usual, Clarke is wrong.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He may be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In spite of his prior agreement with Furneaux&#39;s
estimate of their colleague&#39;s intelligence, Winter felt
nettled at this omniscience. From the outset, his
clear brain had been puzzled by this crime, and Furneaux&#39;s
extraordinary pose was not the least bewildering
feature about it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, come now,&quot; he said, &quot;you cannot have been
here many minutes, and it is early days to speak so
positively. I have been hunting you the whole afternoon&mdash;in
fact, ever since I saw what a ticklish business
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
this was likely to prove&mdash;and I don&#39;t suppose
you have managed to gather all the threads of it
into your fingers so rapidly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There are so few,&quot; muttered Furneaux, looking
down on the carpet with the morbid eyes of one
who saw a terrible vision there.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, it is a good deal to have discovered the
instrument with which the crime was committed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux&#39;s mobile face instantly became alive with
excitement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was a long, thin dagger,&quot; he cried. &quot;Something
in the surgical line, I imagine. Who found it,
and where?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Some men in Winter&#39;s shoes might have smiled in
a superior way. He did not. He knew Furneaux,
profoundly distrusted Clarke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is some mistake,&quot; he contented himself
with saying. &quot;Miss de Bercy was killed by a piece
of flint, shaped like an ax-head&mdash;one of those queer
objects of the stone age which is ticketed carefully
after it is found in an ancient cave, and then put
away in a glass case. Clarke searched the room
this morning, and found it there&mdash;tucked away underneath,&quot;
and he turned round to point to the foot
of the boudoir grand piano, embellished with
Watteaux panels on its rosewood, that stood
in the angle between the door and the nearest
window.</p>

<p class="indent">The animation died out of Furneaux&#39;s features as
quickly as it had appeared there.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
&quot;Useful, of course&quot; he murmured. &quot;Did you
bring it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; it is in my office.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But Mi&mdash;Mademoiselle de Bercy was not killed
in that way. She was supple, active, lithe. She
would have struggled, screamed, probably overpowered
her adversary. No; the doctor admits that
after a hasty examination he jumped to conclusions,
for not one of the external cuts and bruises could
have produced unconsciousness&mdash;not all of them
death. Miss de Bercy was stabbed through the
right eye by something strong and pointed&mdash;something
with a thin, blunt-edged blade. I urged a
thorough examination of the head, and the post
mortem proved the correctness of my theory.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter, one of the shrewdest officials who had ever
won distinction in Scotland Yard, did not fail to
notice that curious slip of a syllable before &quot;Mademoiselle,&quot;
but it was explained a moment later
when Furneaux used the English prefix &quot;Miss&quot;
before the name. It was more natural for Furneaux
to use the French word, however. Winter
spoke French fluently&mdash;like an educated Englishman&mdash;but
Furneaux spoke it like a native of Paris.
The difference between the two was clearly shown
by their pronunciation of &quot;de Bercy.&quot; Winter
sounded three distinct syllables&mdash;Furneaux practically
two, with a slurred &quot;r&quot; that Winter could
not have uttered to save his life.</p>

<p class="indent">Moreover, he was considerably taken aback by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
discovery that Furneaux had evidently been working
on the case during several hours.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have gone into the affair thoroughly, then,&quot;
he blurted out.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes. I read of the murder this morning,
just as I was leaving Kenterstone on my way to
report at the Yard.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Kenterstone!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was almost minded to inquire if the local superintendent
was a fat man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sir Peter and Lady Holt left town early in the
day, so I went to Kenterstone from Brighton late
last night.... The pawnbroker who held Lady
Holt&#39;s diamonds was treating himself to a long weekend
by the sea, and I thought it advisable to see
him in person and explain matters.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A memory of the Finchley Road station-sergeant
who thought that he had seen Furneaux get on a
&#39;bus at 6 p.m. in North London the previous evening
shot through Winter&#39;s mind; but he kept to
the main line of their talk.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you know who this Rose de Bercy really is?&quot;
he suddenly demanded.</p>

<p class="indent">For a second Furneaux seemed to hesitate, but
the reply came in an even tone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have reason to believe that she was born in
Jersey, and that her maiden name was Mirabel Armaud,&quot;
he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Rose Queen of a village fête eight years
ago?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
Perhaps it was Furneaux&#39;s turn to be surprised,
but he showed no sign.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;May I ask how you ascertained that fact?&quot;
he asked quietly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is published in one of the evening papers.
A man who happened to photograph her in Jersey
recognized the likeness when he saw the Academy
portrait of Rose de Bercy. But if you have not
seen his statement already, how did <i>you</i> come to
know that Miss de Bercy was Mirabel Armaud?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am a Jersey man by birth, and, although I
quitted the island early in life, I often go back
there. Indeed, I was present at the very fête you
mention.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose the young lady was in a carriage and
surrounded by a crowd? It would be an odd thing
if you figured in the photograph,&quot; laughed Winter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There have been more unlikely coincidences, but
my early sight of the remarkable woman who was
killed in this room last night explains my intense
desire to track her murderer before Clarke had time
to baffle my efforts. It forms, too, a sort of excuse
for my departure from official routine. Of course,
I would have reported myself this evening, but, up
to the present, I have been working hard to try
and dispel the fog of motive that blocks the way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have heard of Rupert Osborne, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux was certainly not the man whom Winter
was accustomed to meet at other times. Usually
quick as lightning to grasp or discard a point,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
to-night he appeared to experience no little difficulty
in focusing his attention on the topic of the moment.
The mention of Rupert Osborne&#39;s name did not evoke
the characteristically vigorous repudiation that
Winter looked for. Instead, there was a marked
pause, and, when the reply came, it was with an
effort.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. I suppose Clarke wants to arrest him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He has thought of it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But Osborne&#39;s movements last night are so
clearly defined?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So one would imagine, but Clarke still doubts.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter told of the taxicab driver, and the significant
journey taken by his fare. Furneaux shook
his head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Strange, if true,&quot; he said; &quot;why should Osborne
kill the woman he meant to marry?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She may have jilted him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, oh, no. It was&mdash;it must have been&mdash;the
aim of her life to secure a rich husband. She was
beautiful, but cold&mdash;she had the eye that weighs
and measures. Have you ever seen the Monna Lisa
in the Louvre?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter did not answer, conscious of a subtle suspicion
that Furneaux really knew far more of the
inner history of this tragedy than had appeared
hitherto. Clarke, in his own peculiar way, was absurdly
secretive, but that Furneaux should want to
remain silent was certainly baffling.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
&quot;By the way,&quot; said Winter with seeming irrelevance,
&quot;if you were in Brighton and Kenterstone
yesterday afternoon and evening, you had not much
time to spare in London?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then the station-sergeant at Finchley Road was
mistaken in thinking that he saw you in that locality
about six o&#39;clock&mdash;&#39;jumping on to a &#39;bus&#39; was his
precise description of your movements.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was there at that time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How did you manage it? St. John&#39;s Wood is
far away from either Victoria or Charing Cross,
and I suppose you reached Kenterstone by way of
Charing Cross?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I returned from Brighton at three o&#39;clock, and
did not visit Sir Peter Holt until half-past nine
at Kenterstone. Had I disturbed him before dinner
the consequence might have been serious for her
ladyship. Besides, I wished to avoid the local police
at Kenterstone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Both men smiled constrainedly. There was a barrier
between them, and Furneaux, apparently, was
not inclined to remove it; as for Winter, he could
not conquer the impression that, thus far, their conversation
was of a nature that might be looked for
between a police official and a reluctant witness&mdash;assuredly
not between colleagues who were also on
the best of terms as comrades. Furneaux was obviously
on guard, controlling his face, his words, his
very gestures. That so outspoken a man should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
deem it necessary to adopt such a rôle with his close
friend was annoying, but long years of forced self-repression
had taught Winter the wisdom of throttling
back utterances which might be regretted afterwards.
Indeed, he tried valiantly to repair the
fast-widening breach.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have a cigar,&quot; he said, proffering a well-filled
case. &quot;Suppose we just sit down and go through
the affair from A to Z. Much of our alphabet is
missing, but we may be able to guess a few additional
letters.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux smiled again. This time there was the
faintest ripple of amusement in his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, you know how you hate to see me maltreat
a good Havana,&quot; he protested.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This time I forgive you before the offense&mdash;anything
to jolt you into your usual rut. Why, man
alive, here have I been hunting you all day, yet
no sooner are you engaged on the very job for which
I wanted you, than I find myself cross-examining
you as though&mdash;as though you had committed some
flagrant error.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Chief Inspector did not often flounder in his
speech as he had done twice that night. He was
about to say &quot;as though I suspected you of killing
Rose de Bercy yourself&quot;; but his brain generally
worked in front of his voice, and he realized that the
hypothesis would have sounded absurd, almost insane.</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux took the cigar. He did not light it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
but deliberately crushed the wrapper between thumb
and forefinger, and then smelled it with the air of
one who dallies with a full-scented rose, passing it
to and fro under his nostrils. Winter, meantime,
was darting several small rings of smoke through
one wide and slowly dissipating circle, both being
now seated, Winter&#39;s bulk, genially aggressive, well
thrust forward&mdash;but Furneaux, small, compact, a
bundle of nerves under rigid control, was sunk back
into the depths of a large and deep-seated chair, and
seemed to shirk the new task imposed on his powers
of endurance. Winter was so conscious of this
singularly unexpected behavior on his friend&#39;s part
that his conscience smote him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say, old man,&quot; he said, &quot;you look thoroughly
done up. I hardly realized that you had been hard
at work all day. Have you eaten anything?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Had all I wanted,&quot; said Furneaux, thawing a
little under this solicitude.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps you didn&#39;t want enough. Come, own
up. Have you dined?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No&mdash;I was not hungry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where did you lunch?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I ate a good breakfast.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter sprang to his feet again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By Jove!&quot; he cried, &quot;this affair seems to have
taken hold of you&mdash;I meant to send for the hall-porter
and the French maid&mdash;Pauline is her name,
I think; she ought to be able to throw some light
on her mistress&#39;s earlier life&mdash;but we can leave all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
that till to-morrow. Come to my club. A cutlet
and a glass of wine will make a new man of you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux rose at once. Anyone might have believed
that he was glad to postpone the proposed
examination of the servants.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That will be splendid,&quot; he said with an air of
relief that compared markedly with his reticent mood
of the past few minutes. &quot;The mere mention of
food has given me an appetite. I suppose I am
fagged out, or as near it as I have ever been.
Moreover, I can tell you everything that any person
in these Mansions knows of what took place here
between six and eight o&#39;clock last night&mdash;a good
deal more, by the way, than Clarke has found out,
though he scored a point over that stone. Where
is it?&mdash;in the office, you said. I should like to see
it&mdash;in the morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will see more than that. Clarke has arranged
to meet the taxicab driver at ten o&#39;clock.
He meant to confront him with Rupert Osborne,
but we must manage things differently. Of course
the man&#39;s testimony may be important. Alibi or
no alibi, it will be awkward for Osborne if a credible
witness swears that he was in this locality for nearly
a quarter of an hour about the very time that this
poor young lady was killed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux, holding the broken cigar under his
nose, offered no comment, but, as they entered the
hall, he said, glancing at its quaint decoration:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If opportunity makes the thief, so, I imagine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
does it sometimes inspire the murderer. Given the
clear moment, the wish, the fury, can&#39;t you picture
the effect these bizarre surroundings would exercise
on a mind already strung to the madness of crime?
For every willful slayer of a fellow human being is
mad&mdash;mad.... Ah, there was the genius of a
maniac in the choice of that flint ax to rend Mirabel
Armaud&#39;s smooth skin&mdash;yet she had the right to live&mdash;perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He stopped; and Winter anew felt that this musing
Furneaux of to-day was a different personality
from the Furneaux of his intimate knowledge.</p>

<p class="indent">And how compellingly strange it was that he
should choose to describe Rose de Bercy by the name
which she had ceased to bear during many years!
Winter dispelled the scent of the joss-sticks by a
mighty puff of honest tobacco smoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, come along,&quot; he growled, &quot;let us eat&mdash;we
are both in need of it. The flat is untenanted,
of course. Very well, lock the door,&quot; he added, addressing
the policeman. &quot;Leave the key with the
hall-porter, and tell him not to admit anybody, on
any pretext whatsoever, until Mr. Furneaux and I
come here in the morning.&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br/>
A CHANGE OF ADDRESS</h2>

<p class="indent">On the morning after the inquest on Rose de
Bercy, the most miserable young man in London,
in his own estimation, was Mr. Rupert Glendinning
Osborne. Though utterly downcast and disconsolate,
he was in excellent health, and might have
eaten well of the good things on his breakfast table
had he not thoughtlessly opened a newspaper while
stirring his coffee.</p>

<p class="indent">Under other circumstances, he might have laughed
at the atrocious photograph which depicted &quot;Mr.
Rupert Osborne arriving at the coroner&#39;s court.&quot;
The camera had foreshortened an arm, deprived him
of his right leg below the knee, discredited his tailor,
and given him the hang-dog aspect of a convicted
pickpocket, for he had been &quot;snapped&quot; at the moment
of descent from his automobile, when a strong
wind was blowing, and he had been annoyed by the
presence of a gaping crowd.</p>

<p class="indent">The camera had lied, of course. In reality, he
was a good-looking man of thirty, not tall or muscular,
but of well-knit figure, elegant though by no
means effeminate. For a millionaire, and a young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
one, he was by way of being a phenomenon. He
cared little for society; drove his own horses, but
was hardly ever seen in the Park; rode boldly to
hounds, yet refused to patronize a racing stable.
He seldom visited a theater, though he wrote well-informed
articles on the modern French stage for
the <i>New Review</i>; he preferred a pleasant dinner with
a couple of friends to a banquet with hundreds of
acquaintances; in a word, he conducted himself as
a staid citizen whether in New York, or London, or
Paris. Never had a breath of scandal or notoriety
attached itself to his name until he was dragged
into lurid prominence by the stupefying event of
that fatal Tuesday evening.</p>

<p class="indent">Those who knew him best had expressed sheer incredulity
when they first heard of his contemplated
marriage with the French actress. But a man&#39;s
friends, as a rule, are the worst judges of his probable
choice of a partner for life: and Rupert Osborne
was drawn to Rose de Bercy because she possessed
in superabundance those lively qualities and volatile
charms in which he was himself deficient.</p>

<p class="indent">There could be no manner of doubt, however, that
some part of his quivering nervous system had been
seared by statements made about her during the
inquest. It was not soothing for a distraught lover
to learn that Mademoiselle de Bercy&#39;s reminiscences
of her youth were singularly inaccurate. She could
not well have been born in a patrician château on the
Loire, and yet be the daughter of a Jersey potato-grower.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
Her father, Jean Armaud, was stated to
be still living on a small farm near St. Heliers,
whereas her own version of the family history was
that Monsieur le Comte de Bercy did not survive
the crash of the family fortunes in the Panama
swindle. Other discrepancies were not lacking between
official fact and romantic narrative. They
gave Osborne the first glimpse of the abyss into
which he had almost plunged. A loyal-hearted fellow,
he shrank from the hateful consciousness that
the hapless girl&#39;s tragic end had rescued him in all
likelihood from another tragedy, bitter and long
drawn out. But because he had been so foolish as
to fall in love with a beautiful adventuress there
was no reason why he should be blind and deaf when
tardy common sense began to assert itself.</p>

<p class="indent">To a man who habitually shrank from the public
eye, it was bad enough to be dragged into the fierce
light that beats on the witness-box in an inquiry
such as this, but it was far worse to feel in his inmost
heart that he was now looked upon with suspicion
by millions of people in England and America.</p>

<p class="indent">He could not shirk the meaning of the recorded
evidence. The newspapers, it is true, had carefully
avoided the ugly word alibi; but ninety per cent.
of their readers could not fail to see that Rupert
Osborne had escaped arrest solely by reason of the
solid phalanx of testimony as to his movements on
the Tuesday evening before and after the hour of
the murder; the remaining ten per cent. reviled the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
police, and protested, with more or less forceful
adjectives, that &quot;there was one law for the rich and
another for the poor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At the inquest itself, Osborne was too sorrow-laden
and stunned to realize the significance of certain
questions which now seemed to leap at him viciously
from out the printed page.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How were you dressed when you visited Miss
de Bercy that afternoon?&quot; the coroner had asked
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wore a dark gray morning suit and black
silk hat,&quot; he had answered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You did not change your clothing before going
to the Ritz Hotel?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. I drove straight there from Feldisham
Mansions.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you dress for dinner?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. My friends and I discussed certain new
regulations as to the proposed international polo
tournament, and it was nearly eight o&#39;clock before
we concluded the business of the meeting, so we arranged
to dine in the grill-room and go to a Vaudeville
entertainment afterwards.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">That statement had puzzled the coroner. He referred
to his notes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To the Vaudeville?&quot; he queried. &quot;I thought
you went to the Empire Theater?&quot; and Osborne explained
that Americans spoke of &quot;vaudeville&quot; in
the same sense as Englishmen use the word &quot;music-hall&quot;
or &quot;variety.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
&quot;You were with your friends during the whole
time between 6.30 p.m. and midnight?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Practically. I left them for a few minutes
before dinner, but only to go to the writing-room,
where I wrote two short letters.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At what hour, as nearly as you can recollect?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;About ten minutes to eight. I glanced at the
clock when the letters were posted, as I wished to
be sure of catching the American mail.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Were both letters addressed to correspondents
in America?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, one only. The other was to a man about
a dog.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A slight titter relieved the gray monotony of the
court at this explanation, but the coroner frowned it
down, and Rupert added that he was buying a retriever
in readiness for the shooting season.</p>

<p class="indent">But the coroner&#39;s questions suddenly assumed a
sinister import when William Campbell, driver of
taxicab number X L 4001, stated that on the Tuesday
evening, at 7.20, he had taken a gentleman
dressed in a dark gray suit and a tall hat from the
corner of Berkeley Street (opposite the Ritz Hotel)
to the end of the street in Knightsbridge in which
Feldisham Mansions were situated, had waited there
for him for about fifteen minutes, and had brought
him back to Berkeley Street.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought I might know him again, sir, an&#39;, as
I said yesterday&mdash;&mdash;&quot; the man continued, glancing
at Rupert, but he was stopped peremptorily.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
&quot;Never mind what you said yesterday,&quot; broke
in the coroner. &quot;You will have another opportunity
of telling the jury what happened subsequently.
At present I want you to answer my
questions only.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">An ominous hush in the court betrayed the public
appreciation of the issues that might lurk behind
this deferred evidence. Rupert remembered looking
at the driver with a certain vague astonishment,
and feeling that countless eyes were piercing him
without cause.</p>

<p class="indent">The hall-porter, too, Simmonds by name, introduced
a further element of mystery by saying that
at least two gentlemen had gone up the stairs after
Mr. Osborne&#39;s departure in his automobile, and that
one of them bore some resemblance to the young
millionaire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you sure it was not Mr. Osborne?&quot; said
the coroner.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, sir&mdash;leastways, I&#39;m nearly positive.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why do you say that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because Mr. Osborne, like all American gentlemen,
uses the lift, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can any stranger enter the Mansions without
telling you their business?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not as a rule, sir. But it does so happen that
between seven an&#39; eight o&#39;clock I have a lot of things
to attend to, and I often have to run round the
corner to get a taxi for ladies and gentlemen goin&#39;
out to dinner or the theater.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
So, there was a doubt, and Rupert Osborne had
not realized its deadly application to himself until
he read question and answer in cold type while he
toyed with his breakfast on the day after the inquest,
which, by request of Mr. Winter, had been
adjourned for a fortnight.</p>

<p class="indent">It was well for such shreds of stoicism as remained
in his tortured brain that the housemaid was still
unable to give evidence, and that no mention was
made of the stone ax-head found in Rose de Bercy&#39;s
drawing-room. The only official witnesses called
were the constable first summoned by the hall-porter,
and the doctor who made the autopsy. The latter&mdash;who
was positive that Mademoiselle de Bercy had
not been dead many minutes when he was brought
to her flat at ten minutes to eight&mdash;ascribed the
cause of death to &quot;injuries inflicted with a sharp
instrument,&quot; and the coroner, who knew the trend
of the inquiry, would not sate public curiosity by
putting, or permitting the jury to put, any additional
questions until the adjourned inquest.
Neither Clarke nor Furneaux was present in court.
To all seeming, Chief Inspector Winter was in
charge of the proceedings on behalf of the police.</p>

<p class="indent">Rupert ultimately abandoned the effort to eat,
shoved his chair away from the table, and determined
to reperuse with some show of calmness and
criticism, the practically verbatim report of the coroner&#39;s
inquiry.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he saw clearly two things&mdash;Rose de Bercy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
had willfully misled him as to her past life, and he
was now regarded by the public as her probable
betrayer and certain murderer. There was no
blinking the facts. He had almost committed the
imprudence of marrying a woman unworthy of an
honorable man&#39;s love, and, as if such folly called
for condign punishment, he must rest under the
gravest suspicion until her slayer was discovered and
brought to justice.</p>

<p class="indent">Rupert Osborne&#39;s lot had hitherto been cast in
pleasant places, but now he was face to face with
a crisis, and it remained to be seen if the force
that had kept three generations of ancestors in the
forefront of the strenuous commercial warfare of
Wall Street had weakened or wholly vanished in the
person of their dilettante descendant.</p>

<p class="indent">At any rate, he did not flinch from the drab
reality of fact. He read on, striving to be candid
as to meanings and impartial in weighing them.</p>

<p class="indent">At the end of the evidence were two paragraphs
setting forth the newspaper&#39;s own researches. The
first of these ran:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Our correspondent at St. Heliers has ascertained that the
father and sister of the deceased will leave the island by
to-day&#39;s mail steamer for the double purpose of identifying
their relative and attending the funeral. There can be no
question that their first sad task will be in the nature of a
formality. They both admit that Rose de Bercy was none
other than Mirabel Armaud. Mademoiselle Marguerite
Armaud, indeed, bears a striking resemblance to her wayward
sister, while Monsieur Armaud, though crippled with toil and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
rheumatism, shows the same facial characteristics that are so
marked in his two daughters. The family never revealed to
their neighbors in the village any knowledge of Mirabel&#39;s
whereabouts. After her disappearance eight years ago her
name was seldom, if ever, mentioned to any of their friends,
and their obvious wishes in the matter soon came to be
respected by would-be sympathizers. It is certain, however,
that Marguerite, on one occasion, dared her father&#39;s anger
and went to Paris to plead with her sister and endeavor to
bring her home. She failed, as might be expected, since Rose
de Bercy was then attaining the summit of her ambition by
playing a small part in a play at the Gymnase, though at that
period no one in Paris was able to foresee the remarkable
success she was destined to achieve on the stage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Each word cut like a knife. The printed statements
were cruel, but the inferences were far worse.
Rupert felt sick at heart; nevertheless he compelled
himself to gather the sense of the next item:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="indent">It was a favorite pose of Mademoiselle de Bercy&mdash;using
the name by which the dead actress was best known&mdash;to
describe herself as an Anarchist. It is certain that she attended
several Anarchist meetings in Paris, probably for
amusement or for professional study of an interesting type,
and in this connection it is a somewhat singular coincidence
that Detective-Inspector Clarke, who was mentioned on Wednesday
as being in charge of the police investigations into
the murder, should have arrested two notorious Anarchists
on the Thames Embankment yesterday shortly before the
Tsar passed that way <i>en route</i> to the Guildhall. The two
men, who refused to give any information as to their identity,
were said to be none other than Emile Janoc and Antoine
Descartes, both well-known French revolutionaries. They
were brought before the Extradition Court, and ordered to
be deported, the specific charge against them being the carrying
of fire-arms without a license. It was stated that on each
man was found an unloaded revolver.</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
So far as Rupert could judge, the newspaper
was merely pandering to the craze for sensationalism
in bracketing Rose de Bercy with a couple of
unwashed scoundrels from Montmartre. On one
occasion, indeed, she had mentioned to him her visits
to an Anarchist club; but their object was patent
when she exhibited a collection of photographs and
laudatory press notices of herself in the stage part
of a Russian lady of high rank who masqueraded
as a Terrorist in order to save her lover from assassination.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It would have been only fair,&quot; he growled savagely,
&quot;if the fellow who is raking up her past so
assiduously had placed on record her appearance on
the stage as <i>Marie Dukarovna</i>. And who is this
detective who made the arrests? Clarke was not
the name of the man I met yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then he groaned. His glance had just caught a
detailed description of himself, his tastes, his family
history, and his wealth. It was reasonably accurate,
and not unkindly in tone, but it grated terribly at
the moment, and in sheer desperation of spirit he
crushed the newspaper in his clenched hands.</p>

<p class="indent">At that instant his man entered. Even the quiet-voiced
and impenetrable-faced Jenkins spoke in an
awed tone when he announced:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Chief Inspector Winter, of Scotland Yard,
wishes to see you, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well, show him in; and don&#39;t be scared,
Jenkins. He will not arrest <i>you</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
Rupert must have been stung beyond endurance
before he would fling such a taunt at his faithful
servitor. Jenkins, at a loss for a disclaimer, glanced
reproachfully at the table.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have hardly eaten a morsel, sir,&quot; he said.
&quot;Shall I bring some fresh coffee and an egg?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then Rupert laughed grimly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wait till I have seen Mr. Winter,&quot; he said.
&quot;Perhaps he may join me. If he refuses, Jenkins,
be prepared for the worst.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But the Chief Inspector did not refuse. He admitted
that coffee-drinking and smoking were his pet
vices, and his breezy cheerfulness at once established
him on good terms with his host.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want you to understand, Mr. Osborne, that
my presence here this morning is entirely in your
interests,&quot; he said when they were seated, and Rupert
was tackling a belated meal. &quot;The more fully
we clear up any doubtful points as to your proceedings
on Tuesday the more easy it will be for the
police to drop you practically out of the inquiry
except as an unimportant witness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rupert&#39;s heart warmed to this genial-mannered
official.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is very kind of you to put things in that
light when every newspaper in the country is
prepared to announce my arrest at any moment,&quot;
he replied.</p>

<p class="indent">Winter was astonished. His face showed it; his
big blue eyes positively bulged with surprise.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
&quot;Arrest!&quot; he cried. &quot;Why should I arrest you,
sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, after the chauffeur&#39;s evidence&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is exactly what brings me here. Personally,
I have no doubt whatsoever that you did
not leave the Ritz Hotel between half-past six and
nine o&#39;clock on the evening of the murder. Two
of your friends on the committee saw you writing
those letters, and the clerk at the inquiry desk remembers
supplying you with stamps. Just as a
matter of form, you might give me the names of
your correspondents?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rupert supplied the desired information, which
Winter duly scribbled in a notebook, but it did not
escape the American&#39;s usually quick perception that
his visitor had already verified the statement made
before the coroner. That being so, some other motive
lay behind this visit. What was it?</p>

<p class="indent">Winter, at the moment, seemed to be fascinated
by the leaf-color and aroma of the cigar which
Jenkins had brought with the coffee. He puffed,
smelled, pinched, and scrutinized&mdash;was completely
absorbed, in fact.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you like it?&quot; asked Osborne, smiling.
The suggestion was almost staggering to the Chief
Inspector.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, of course I do,&quot; he cried. &quot;This is a prize
cigar. You young gentlemen who are lucky
enough to command practically unlimited money can
generally obtain anything you want, but I am bound
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
to say, Mr. Osborne, that you could not buy a
thousand cigars like this in London to-day, no matter
what price you paid.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I imagine you are right,&quot; said Rupert. &quot;The
estate on which that tobacco was grown is one of
the smallest in Cuba, but it is on the old rich belt.
My manager is a scientist. He knows to half an
ounce per acre how much sulphate of potash to add
each year.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sulphate of potash?&quot; questioned Winter, ever
ready to assimilate fresh lore on the subject of the
weed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, that is the secret of the flavor, plus the
requisite conditions of soil and climate, of course.
The tobacco plant is a great consumer of mineral
constituents. A rusty nail, a pinch of salt, and
a small lump of lime, placed respectively near the
roots of three plants in the same row, will produce
three absolutely different varieties of tobacco, but
all three will be inferior to the plants removed from
such influences.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear me!&quot; said Winter, &quot;how very interesting!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But to his own mind he was saying: &quot;Why in
the world did Furneaux refuse to meet this nice
young fellow? Really, this affair grows more complex
every hour.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Osborne momentarily forgot his troubles in the
company of this affable official. It was comforting,
too, that his hospitality should be accepted. Somehow,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
he felt certain that Winter would have declined
it if any particle of suspicion had been attached to
the giver, and therein his knowledge of men did not
deceive him. With a lighter heart, therefore, than
he would have thought possible a few minutes earlier,
he, too, lit a cigar.</p>

<p class="indent">Winter saw that Rupert was waiting for him to
resume the conversation momentarily broken. He
began with a straightforward question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, Mr. Osborne,&quot; he said, &quot;will you kindly
tell me if it is true that you were about to marry
Mademoiselle de Bercy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is quite true.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How long have you known her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Since she came to London last fall.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose you made no inquiries as to her past
life?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, none. I never gave a thought to such a
thing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose you see now that it would have been
wiser had you done something of the kind?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wisdom and love seldom go hand in hand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Chief Inspector nodded agreement. His profession
had failed utterly to oust sentiment from
his nature.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At any rate,&quot; he said, &quot;her life during the past
nine months has been an open book to you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We soon became friends. Since early in the
spring I think I could tell you of every engagement
Mademoiselle de Bercy fulfilled, and name almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
every person she met, barring such trivialities as
shopping fixtures and the rest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah; then you would know if she had an enemy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;think so. I have never heard of one. She
had hosts of friends&mdash;all sympathetic.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What was the precise object of your visit on
Tuesday?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I took her a book on Sicily. We&mdash;we had
practically decided on Taormina for our honeymoon.
As I would be occupied until a late hour,
she arranged to dine with Lady Knox-Florestan and
go to the opera to hear <i>Pagliacci</i>. It was played
after <i>Philémon et Baucis</i>, so the dinner was fixed for
half-past eight.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Would anyone except yourself and Lady Knox-Florestan
be aware of that arrangement?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why did she telephone to Lady Knox-Florestan
at 7.30 and plead illness as an excuse for not coming
to the dinner?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rupert looked thoroughly astounded. &quot;That is
the first I have heard of it,&quot; he cried.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Could she have had any powerful reason for
changing her plans?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot say. Not to <i>my</i> knowledge, most certainly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did she expect any visitor after your departure?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. Two of her servants were out for the
evening, and the housemaid would help her to dress.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
Winter looked at the American with a gleam of
curiosity when the housemaid was mentioned.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did this girl, the housemaid, open the door when
you left?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. I just rushed away. She admitted me,
but I did not see her afterwards.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then she may have fancied that you took your
departure much later?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Possibly, though hardly likely, since her room
adjoins the entrance, and, as it happened, I banged
the door accidentally in closing it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter was glad that a man whom he firmly believed
to be innocent of any share in the crime had
made an admission that might have told against
him under hostile examination.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Suppose&mdash;just suppose&mdash;&quot; he said, &quot;that the
housemaid, being hysterical with fright, gave evidence
that you were in Feldisham Mansions at half-past
seven&mdash;how would you explain it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your own words &#39;hysterical with fright&#39; might
serve as her excuse. At half-past seven I was arguing
against the ever-increasing height of polo
ponies, with the rest of the committee against me.
Does the girl say any such thing?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Girls are queer sometimes,&quot; commented Winter
airily. &quot;But let that pass. I understand, Mr.
Osborne, that you have given instructions to the
undertaker?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rupert flinched a little.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What choice had I in the matter?&quot; he demanded.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
&quot;I thought that Mademoiselle de Bercy was an
orphan&mdash;that all her relatives were dead.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, yes. Even now, I fancy, you mean to
attend the funeral to-morrow?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course. Do you imagine I would desert
my promised wife at such an hour&mdash;no matter what
was revealed&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, Mr. Osborne, I did not think it for one
instant. And that brings me to the main object of
my visit. Please be advised by me&mdash;don&#39;t go to
the funeral. Better still, leave London for a few
days. Lose yourself till the day before the adjourned
inquest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But why&mdash;in Heaven&#39;s name?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because appearances are against you. The
public mind&mdash;I had better be quite candid. The
man in the street is a marvelous detective, in his own
opinion. Being an idler, he will turn up in his
thousands at Feldisham Mansions and Kensal Green
Cemetery to-morrow afternoon, and, if you are present,
there may be a regrettable scene. Moreover,
you will meet a warped old peasant named Jean
Armaud and a narrow-souled village girl in his
daughter Marguerite. Take my advice&mdash;pack a
kit-bag, jump into a cab, and bury yourself in some
seaside town. Let me know where you are&mdash;as I
may want to communicate with you&mdash;and&mdash;er&mdash;when
you send your address, don&#39;t forget to sign
your letter in the same way as you sign the hotel
register.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
Rupert rose and looked out of the window. He
could not endure that another man should see the
agony in his face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you in earnest?&quot; he said, when he felt that
his voice might be trusted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dead in earnest, Mr. Osborne,&quot; came the quiet
answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You even advise me to adopt an alias?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Call it a <i>nom de voyage</i>,&quot; said Winter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall be horribly lonely. May I not take my
valet?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take no one. I suppose you can leave some
person in charge of your affairs?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have a secretary. But she and my servants
will think my conduct very strange.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall call here to-morrow and tell your secretary
you have left London for a few days at my
request. What is her name?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Prout&mdash;Miss Hylda Prout. She comes here at
11 a.m. and again at 3 p.m.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see. Then I may regard that matter as
settled?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Again there was silence for a time. Oddly
enough, Rupert was conscious of a distinct feeling
of relief.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well,&quot; he said at last. &quot;I shall obey you
to the letter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you. I am sure you are acting for the
best.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter, whose eyes had noted every detail of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
room while Rupert&#39;s back was turned, rose as if his
mission were accomplished.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Won&#39;t you have another cigar?&quot; said Rupert.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, yes. It is a sin to smoke these cigars so
early in the day&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let me send you a hundred.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no. I am very much obliged, but&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Please allow me to do this. Don&#39;t you see?&mdash;if
I tell Jenkins, in your presence, to pack and forward
them, it will stifle a good deal of the gossip
which must be going on even in my own household.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well&mdash;from that point of view, Mr. Osborne&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, I cannot express my gratitude, but, when
all this wretched business is ended, we must meet
under happier conditions.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He touched a bell, and Jenkins appeared.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Send a box of cigars to Chief Inspector Winter,
at Scotland Yard, by special messenger,&quot; said Rupert,
with as careless an air as he could assume.</p>

<p class="indent">Jenkins gurgled something that sounded like
&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; and went out hastily. Rupert spread
his hands with a gesture of utmost weariness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are right about the man in the street,&quot;
he sighed. &quot;Even my own valet feared that you
had come to arrest me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ha, ha!&quot; laughed Winter.</p>

<p class="indent">But when Jenkins, discreetly cheerful, murmured
&quot;Good-day, sir,&quot; and the outer door was closed behind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
him, Winter&#39;s strong face wore its prizefighter
aspect.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Clarke <i>would</i> have arrested him,&quot; he said to himself.
&quot;But that man did not kill Mirabel Armaud.
Then who did kill her? <i>I</i> don&#39;t know, yet I believe
that Furneaux guesses. <i>Who</i> did it? Damme, it
beats me, and the greatest puzzle of all is to read
the riddle of Furneaux.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br/>
THE NEW LIFE</h2>

<p class="indent">No sooner did Rupert begin to consider ways
and means of adopting Winter&#39;s suggestion than
he encountered difficulties. &quot;Pack a kit-bag, jump
into a cab, and bury yourself in some seaside town&quot;
might be the best of counsel; but it was administered
in tabloid form; when analyzed, the ingredients became
formidable. For instance, the Chief Inspector
had apparently not allowed for the fact that a
man in Osborne&#39;s station would certainly carry his
name or initials on his clothing, linen, and portmanteaux,
and on every article in his dressing-case.</p>

<p class="indent">Despite his other troubles&mdash;which were real
enough to a man who loathed publicity&mdash;Rupert
found himself smiling in perplexity when he endeavored
to plan some means of hoodwinking Jenkins.
Moreover, he could not help feeling that
his identity would be proclaimed instantly when a
sharp-eyed hotel valet or inquisitive chambermaid
examined his belongings. He was sure that some
of the newspapers would unearth a better portrait
of himself than the libelous snapshot reproduced
that day, in which event no very acute intelligence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
would be needed to connect &quot;Osborne&quot; or &quot;R. G.
O.&quot; with the half-tone picture. Of course, he could
buy ready-made apparel, but the notion was displeasing;
ultimately, he abandoned the task and
summoned Jenkins.</p>

<p class="indent">Jenkins was one of those admirable servants&mdash;bred
to perfection in London only&mdash;worthy of a
coat of arms with the blazoned motto: &quot;Leave it
to me.&quot; His sallow, almost ascetic, face brightened
under the trust reposed in him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is now half-past ten, sir,&quot; he said. &quot;Will
it meet your convenience if I have everything ready
by two o&#39;clock?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose so,&quot; said his master ruefully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What station shall I bring your luggage to,
sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, any station. Let me see&mdash;say Waterloo,
main line.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you will be absent ten days or thereabouts,
sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is the proposition as it stands now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well, sir. I shall want some money&mdash;not
more than twenty pounds&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rupert opened a door leading to the library. He
rented a two-story maisonette in Mayfair, with the
drawing-room, dining-room, library, billiard-room
and domestic offices grouped round the hall, while
the upper floor was given over to bedrooms and
dressing-rooms. His secretary was not arrived as
yet; but he had already glanced through a pile of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
letters with the practiced eye of one who receives
daily a large and varied correspondence.</p>

<p class="indent">He wrote a check for a hundred pounds, and
stuffed the book into a breast pocket.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There,&quot; he said to Jenkins, &quot;cash that, buy
what you want, and bring me the balance in five-pound
notes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, sir, but will you please remember to pack
the clothes you are now wearing into a parcel, and
post them to me this evening?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By gad, Jenkins, I should have forgotten that
my name is stitched on to the back of the coat I
am wearing. How will you manage about my other
things?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rip off the tabs, sir, and get you some new
linen, unmarked.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good. But I may as well leave my checkbook
here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, sir, take it with you. You may want it.
If you do, the money will be of more importance
than the name.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Right again, Socrates. I wish I might take
you along, too, but our Scotland Yard friend said
&#39;No,&#39; so you must remain and answer callers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have sent away more than a dozen this morning,
sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh? Who were they?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Newspaper gentlemen, sir, every one of &#39;em,
though they tried various dodges to get in and have
a word with you. If I were you, sir, I would drive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
openly in the motor to some big hotel, and let your
car remain outside while you slip out by another
door.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jenkins, you seem to be up to snuff in these
matters.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, sir, I had a good training with Lord
Dunningham. His lordship was a very free and
easy sort of gentleman, and I never did meet his
equal at slipping a writter. They gave it up at
last, and went in for what they call substitooted
service.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A bell rang, and they heard a servant crossing the
hall.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That will be Miss Prout, sir,&quot; said Jenkins.
&quot;What shall I tell her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing. Mr. Winter will see her in the morning.
Now, let us be off out of this before she
comes in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rupert was most unwilling to frame any subterfuge
that might help to explain his absence to his
secretary. She had been so manifestly distressed
in his behalf the previous day, that he decided to
avoid her now, being anxious not to hurt her feelings
by any display of reticence as to his movements.
As soon as the library door closed behind
the newcomer, he went to his dressing-room and remained
there until his automobile was in readiness.
He was spoken to twice and snapshotted three times
while he ran down the steps and crossed the pavement;
but he gave no heed to his tormentors, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
his chauffeur, quick to appreciate the fact that a
couple of taxicabs were following, ran into Hyde
Park by the nearest gate, thus shaking off
pursuit, since vehicles licensed to ply for hire
are not allowed to enter London&#39;s chief pleasure-ground.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Rupert to himself, &quot;Winter is right.
The solitary cliff and the deserted village for me
during the next fortnight. But where are they to
be found? England, with August approaching, is
full to the brim.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He decided to trust to chance, and therein lay
the germ of complications which might well have
given him pause, could he have peered into the
future.</p>

<p class="indent">Having successfully performed the trick of the
cab &quot;bilker&quot; by leaving his motor outside a hotel,
Rupert hurried away from the main stream of
fashion along several narrow streets until his attention
was caught by a tiny restaurant on which the
day&#39;s eatables were scrawled in French. It was in
Soho; an open-air market promised diversion; and
he was wondering how winkles tasted, extracted from
their shells with a pin, when some commotion arose
at the end of an alley. A four-wheeled cab had
wormed its way through a swarm of picturesque
loafers, and was drawn up close to the kerb. Pavement
and street were pullulating with child life, and
the appearance from the interior of the cab of a
couple of strongly-built, square-shouldered men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
seemed to send an electric wave through adults and
children alike.</p>

<p class="indent">Instantly there was a rush, and Rupert was pinned
in the crowd between a stout Frenchwoman and a
young Italian who reeked of the kitchen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it, then?&quot; he asked, addressing madame
in her own language.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are police agents, those men there,&quot; she
answered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have they come to make an arrest?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But no, monsieur. Two miserables who call
themselves Anarchists have been sent back to France,
and the police are taking their luggage. A nice
thing, chasing such scarecrows and letting that bad
American who killed Mademoiselle de Bercy go free.
Poor lady! I saw her many times. Ah, <i>mon Dieu</i>,
how I wept when I read of her terrible end!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rupert caught his breath. So he was judged
and found guilty even in the gutter!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps the police know that Monsieur Osborne
did not kill her,&quot; he managed to say in a muffled
tone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, là, là!&quot; cried the woman. &quot;He has money,
<i>ce vilain</i> Osborne!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The ironic phrase was pitiless. It denounced,
condemned, explained. Rupert forced a laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Truly, money can do almost anything,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">A detective came out of the passage, laden with
dilapidated packages. The woman smiled broadly,
saying:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
&quot;My faith, they do not prosper, those Anarchists.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rupert edged his way through the crowd. On
the opposite side of the street the contents bills of
the early editions of the evening newspapers glared
at him: &quot;West End murder&mdash;Relatives sail from
Jersey.&quot; &quot;Portrait sketch of Osborne&quot;; &quot;Paris
Life of Rose de Bercy&quot;; the horror of it all suddenly
stifled his finer impulses: from that hour Rupert
squared his shoulders and meant to scowl at
the jeering multitude.</p>

<p class="indent">Probably because he was very rich, he cultivated
simple tastes in the matter of food. At one o&#39;clock
he ate some fruit and a cake or two, drank a glass
of milk, and noticed that the girl in the cashier&#39;s
desk was actually looking at his own &quot;portrait
sketch&quot; when he tendered her a shilling. About
half-past one he took a hansom to Waterloo Station,
where he bought a map and railway guide at the
bookstall, and soon decided that Tormouth on the
coast of Dorset offered some prospect of a quiet
anchorage.</p>

<p class="indent">So, when Jenkins came with a couple of new
leather bags, Rupert bought a third-class ticket.
Traveling in a corridor compartment, he heard the
Feldisham Mansions crime discussed twice during the
afternoon. Once he was described as a &quot;reel bad
lot&mdash;one of them fellers &#39;oo &#39;ad too little to do an&#39;
too much to do it on.&quot; When, at Winchester, these
critics alighted, their places were taken by a couple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
of young women; and the train had hardly started
again before the prettier of the two called her
companion&#39;s attention to a page in an illustrated
paper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor thing! Wasn&#39;t she a beauty?&quot; she asked,
pointing to a print of the Academy portrait of
Mademoiselle de Bercy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can never tell&mdash;them photographs are so
touched up,&quot; was the reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s no touching up of Osborne, is there?&quot;
giggled the other, looking at the motor-car photograph.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, indeed. He looks as if he had just done
it,&quot; said the friend.</p>

<p class="indent">A lumbering omnibus took him to Tormouth. At
the Swan Hotel he haggled about the terms, and
chose a room at ten shillings per diem instead of
the plutocratic apartment first offered at twelve and
six. In the register he signed &quot;R. Glyn, London,&quot;
and at once wrote to Winter. He almost laughed
when he found that Jenkins&#39;s address on the label
was some street in North London, where that excellent
man&#39;s sister dwelt.</p>

<p class="indent">He found that Tormouth possessed one great
merit&mdash;an abundance of sea air. It was a quiet
old place, a town of another century, cut off from
the rush of modern life by the frenzied opposition
to railways displayed by its local magnates fifty
years earlier. Rupert could not have selected a
better retreat. He dined, slept, ate three hearty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
meals next day, and slept again with a soundness
that argued him free from care.</p>

<p class="indent">But newspapers reached even Tormouth, and, on
the second morning after his arrival, Osborne&#39;s bitter
mood returned when he read an account of Rose
de Bercy&#39;s funeral. The crowds anticipated by
Winter were there, the reporters duly chronicled
Rupert&#39;s absence, and there could be no gainsaying
the eagerness of the press to drag in his name on
the slightest pretext.</p>

<p class="indent">But the arrows of outrageous fortune seemed to
be less barbed when he found himself on a lonely
path that led westward along the cliffs, and his
eyes dwelt on the far-flung loveliness of a sapphire
sea reflecting the tint of a turquoise sky. A pleasant
breeze that just sufficed to chisel the surface of the
water into tiny facets flowed lazily from the south.
From the beach, some twenty feet or less beneath
the low cliff, came the murmur of a listless tide.
On the swelling uplands of Dorset shone glorious
patches of gold and green, with here and there a
hamlet or many-ricked farm, while in front, a mile
away, the cliff climbed with a gentle curve to a fine
headland that jutted out from the shore-line like
some great pier built by a genie for the caravels
of giants. It was a morning to dispel shadows, and
the cloud lifted from Rupert&#39;s heart under its cheery
influence. He stopped to light a cigar, and from
that moment Rupert&#39;s regeneration was complete.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is a shame to defile this wonderful atmosphere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
with tobacco smoke,&quot; he mused, &quot;so I must salve
my conscience by burning incense to the spirit of
the place. That sort of spirit is invariably of the
female gender. Where is the lady? Invisible, of
course.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Without the least expectation of discovering
either fay or mortal on the yellow sands that spread
their broad highway between sea and cliff, Rupert
stepped off the path on to the narrow strip of turf
that separated it from the edge and looked down
at the beach. Greatly to his surprise, a girl sat
there, painting. She had rigged a big Japanese
umbrella to shield herself and her easel from the
sun. Its green-hued paper cover, gay with pink
dragons and blue butterflies, brought a startling
note of color into the placid foreground. The girl,
or young woman, wore a very smart hat, but her
dress was a grayish brown costume, sufficiently indeterminate
in tint to conceal the stains of rough
usage in climbing over rocks, or forcing a way
through rank vegetation. Indeed, it was chosen,
in the first instance, so that a dropped brush or a
blob of paint would not show too vivid traces; and
this was well, for some telepathic action caused the
wearer to lift her eyes to the cliff the very instant
after Rupert&#39;s figure broke the sky-line above the
long grasses nodding on the verge. The result was
lamentable. She squeezed half a tube of crimson
lake over her skirt in a movement of surprise at the
apparition.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
She was annoyed, and, of course, blamed the man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you want?&quot; she demanded. &quot;Why
creep up in that stealthy fashion?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t,&quot; said Rupert.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you did.&quot; This with a pout, while she
scraped the paint off her dress with a palette knife.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am very sorry that you should have cause to
think so,&quot; he said. &quot;Will you allow me to explain&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As he stepped forward, lifting his hat, the girl
cried a warning, but too late; a square yard of dry
earth crumbled into dust beneath him, and he fell
headlong. Luckily, the strata of shale and marl
which formed the coast-line at that point had been
scooped by the sea into a concavity, with a ledge,
which Rupert reached before he had dropped half-way.
Some experience of Alpine climbing had made
him quick to decide how best to rectify a slip, and
he endeavored now to spring rather than roll downward
to the beach, since he had a fleeting vision
of a row of black rocks that guarded the foot of
the treacherous cliff. He just managed to clear an
ugly boulder that would have taken cruel toll of
bruised skin, if no worse, had he struck it, but he
landed on a smooth rock coated with seaweed. Exactly
what next befell neither he nor the girl ever
knew. He performed some wild gyration, and was
brought up forcibly by the bamboo shaft of the
umbrella, to which he found himself clinging in a
sitting posture. His trousers were split across both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
knees, his coat was ripped open under the left arm,
and he felt badly bruised; nevertheless, he looked up
into the girl&#39;s frightened face, and laughed, on
which the fright vanished from her eyes, and she,
too, laughed, with such ready merriment and display
of white teeth, that Rupert laughed again.
He picked himself up and stretched his arms slowly,
for something had given him a tremendous thump
in the ribs.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Page 61</i></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you hurt?&quot; cried the girl, anxiety again
chasing the mirth from her expressive features.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; he said, after a deep breath had convinced
him that no bones were broken. &quot;I only wished
to explain that your word &#39;stealthy&#39; was undeserved.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I withdraw it, then.... I saw you were a
stranger, so it is my fault that you fell. I ought
to have told you about that dangerous cliff instead
of pitching into you because you startled
me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t agree with you there,&quot; smiled Rupert.
&quot;We were both taken by surprise, but I might have
known better than to stand so near the edge. Good
job I was not a mile farther west,&quot; and he nodded
in the direction of the distant headland.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, please don&#39;t think of it, or I shall dream
to-night of somebody falling over the Tor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that the Tor?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; don&#39;t you know? You are visiting Tormouth,
I suppose?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
&quot;I have been here since the day before yesterday,
but my local knowledge is nil.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, if I were you, I should go home and
change my clothes. How did your coat get torn?
Are you sure you are not injured?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He turned to survey the rock on which his feet
had slipped. Between it and the umbrella the top
of a buried boulder showed through the deep sand,
ever white and soft at highwater mark.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am inclined to believe that I butted into that
fellow during the hurricane,&quot; he said. Then, feeling
that an excuse must be forthcoming, if he wished
to hear more of this girl&#39;s voice, and look for a
little while longer into her face, he threw a plaintive
note into a request.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Would you mind if I sat down for a minute or
so?&quot; he asked. &quot;I feel a bit shaken. After
the briefest sort of rest I shall be off to the
Swan.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sit down at once,&quot; she said with ready sympathy.
&quot;Here, take this,&quot; and she made to give
him the canvas chair from which she had risen at
the first alarm.</p>

<p class="indent">He dropped to the sand with suspicious ease.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall be quite comfortable here,&quot; he said.
&quot;Please go on with your painting. I always find it
soothing to watch an artist at work.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must be going home now,&quot; she answered. &quot;I
obtain this effect only at a certain stage of
tide, and early in the day. You see, the Tor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
changes his appearance so rapidly when the sun
travels round to the south.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you live at Tormouth?&quot; he ventured to ask.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Half a mile out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you allow me to carry something for you?
I find that I have broken two ribs&mdash;of your umbrella,&quot;
he added instantly, seeing that those radiant
eyes of hers had turned on him with quick solicitude.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pity,&quot; she murmured, &quot;bamboo is so much
harder to mend than bone. No&mdash;you will not carry
anything. I think, if you are staying at the Swan,
you will find a path up a little hollow in the cliff
about a hundred yards from here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and if you, too, are going&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In the opposite direction.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, well,&quot; he said, &quot;I am a useless person, it
seems. Good-by. May I fall at your feet again
to-morrow?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The absurd question brought half a smile to her
lips. She began to reply: &quot;Worship so headlong&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then she saw that which caused her face to blanch.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, your right hand is smothered in blood&mdash;something
has happened&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He glanced at his hand, which a pebble had cut
on one of the knuckles; and he valiantly resisted the
temptation that presented itself, and stood upright.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is a mere scratch,&quot; he assured her. &quot;If I
wash it in salt water it will be healed before I reach
Tormouth. Good-by&mdash;mermaid. I believe you live
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
in a cavern&mdash;out there&mdash;beneath the Tor. Some
day soon I shall swim out among the rocks and look
for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With that he stooped to recover his hat, walked
seaward to find a pool, and held his hand in the water
until the wound was cauterized. Then he lit another
cigar, and saw out of the tail of his eye that the
girl was now on the top of the cliff at some distance
to the west.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder who she is,&quot; he murmured. &quot;A lady,
at any rate, and a very charming one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And the girl was saying:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is he?&mdash;A gentleman, I see. American?
Something in the accent, perhaps. Or perhaps not.
Americans don&#39;t come to torpid old Tormouth.&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br/>
THE MISSING BLADE</h2>

<p class="indent">On that same morning of the meeting on the sands
at Tormouth, Inspector Clarke, walking southward
down St. Martin&#39;s Lane toward Scotland Yard, had
a shock. Clarke was hardly at the moment in his
best mood, for to the natural vinegar of his temperament
a drop of lemon, or of gall, had been added
within the last few days. That morning at breakfast
he had explained matters with a sour mouth to
Mrs. Clarke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, it was all a made-up job between Winter
and Furneaux, and I was only put on to the Anarchists
to make room for Furneaux&mdash;that was it.
The two Anarchists weren&#39;t up to any mischief&mdash;&#39;Anarchists&#39;
was all a blind, that&#39;s what &#39;<i>Anarchists</i>&#39;
was. But that&#39;s the way things are run now
in the Yard, and there&#39;s no fair play going any
more. Furneaux must have Feldisham Mansions, of
course; Furneaux this, and Furneaux that&mdash;of
course. But wait: he hasn&#39;t solved it yet! and he
isn&#39;t going to; no, and I haven&#39;t done with it yet, not
by a long way.... Now, where do you buy these
eggs? Just look at this one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
The fact was, now that the two Anarchists, Descartes
and Janoc, had been deported by the Court,
and were gone, Clarke suddenly woke to find himself
disillusioned, dull, excluded from the fun of the
chase. But, as he passed down St. Martin&#39;s Lane
that morning, his underlooking eyes, ever on the
prowl for the &quot;confidence men&quot; who haunt the West
End, saw a sight that made him doubt if he was
awake. There, in a little by-street to the east,
under the three balls of a pawnbroker&#39;s, he saw, or
dreamt that he saw&mdash;Émile Janoc!&mdash;Janoc, whom
he <i>knew</i> to be in Holland, and Janoc was so deep,
so lost, in talk with a girl, that he could not see
Clarke standing there, looking at him.</p>

<p class="indent">And Clarke knew the girl, too! It was Bertha
Seward, the late cook of the murdered actress, Rose
de Bercy.</p>

<p class="indent">Could he be mistaken as to Janoc? he asked himself.
Could <i>two</i> men be so striking to the eye, and
so alike&mdash;the lank figure, stooping; the long wavering
legs, the clothes hanging loose on him; the
scraggy throat with the bone in it; the hair, black
and plenteous as the raven&#39;s breast, draping the
sallow-dark face; the eyes so haggard, hungry, unresting.
Few men were so picturesque: few so
greasy, repellent. And there could be no mistake as
to Bertha Seward&mdash;a small, thin creature, with whitish
hair, and little Chinese eyes that seemed to twinkle
with fun&mdash;it was she!</p>

<p class="indent">And how earnest was the talk!</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
Clarke saw Janoc clasp his two long hands together,
and turn up his eyes to the sky, seeming to
beseech the girl or, through her, the heavens. Then
he offered her money, which she refused; but, when
he cajoled and insisted, she took it, smiling. Shaking
hands, they parted, and Janoc looked after Bertha
Seward as she hurried, with a sort of stealthy
haste, towards the Strand. Then he turned, and
found himself face to face with Clarke.</p>

<p class="indent">For a full half-minute they looked contemplatively,
eye to eye, at one another.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Janoc?&quot; said Clarke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is my name for one moment, sare,&quot; said
Janoc politely in a very peculiar though fluent English:
&quot;and the yours, sare?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Unless you have a very bad memory you know
mine! How on earth come you to be here, Émile
Janoc?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;England is free country, sare,&quot; said Janoc with
a shrug; &quot;I see not the why I must render you
account of movement. Only I tell you this time,
because you are so singular familiarly with
my name of family, you deceive yourself as to
my little name. I have, it is true, a brother named
Émile&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Clarke looked with a hard eye at him. The resemblance,
if they were two, was certainly very
strong. Since it seemed all but impossible that
Émile Janoc should be in England, he accepted the
statement grudgingly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
&quot;Perhaps you wouldn&#39;t mind letting me see your
papers?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">Janoc bowed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That I will do with big pleasure, sare,&quot; he said,
and produced a passport recently viséd in Holland,
by which it appeared that his name was not Émile,
but Gaston.</p>

<p class="indent">They parted with a bow on Janoc&#39;s side and a nod
on Clarke&#39;s; but Clarke was puzzled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Something queer about this,&quot; he thought. &quot;I&#39;ll
keep my eye on <i>him</i>.... What was he doing talking
like that&mdash;<i>so earnest</i>&mdash;to the actress&#39;s cook?
Suppose she was murdered by Anarchists? It is
certain that she was more or less mixed up with them&mdash;more,
perhaps, than is known. Why did those
two come over the night after her murder?&mdash;for it&#39;s
clear that they had no design against the Tsar.
I&#39;ll look into it on my own. Easy, now, Clarke, my
boy, and may be you&#39;ll come out ahead of Furneaux,
Winter, and all the lot in the end.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When he arrived at his Chief&#39;s office in the Yard,
he mentioned to Winter his curious encounter with
the other Janoc, but said not a word of Bertha
Seward, since the affair of the murder was no longer
his business, officially.</p>

<p class="indent">Winter paid little heed to Janoc, whether Émile
or Gaston, for Furneaux was there with him, and the
two were head to head, discussing the murder, and
the second sitting of the inquest was soon to come.
Indeed, Clarke heard Winter say to Furneaux:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
&quot;I promised Mr. Osborne to give some sort of
excuse to his servants for his flight from home. I
was so busy that I forgot it. Perhaps you will see
to that, too, for me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Glad you mentioned it. I intended going there
at once,&quot; Furneaux said in that subdued tone which
seemed to have all at once come upon him since Rose
de Bercy was found lying dead in Feldisham Mansions.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, then, from henceforth everything is in
your hands,&quot; said Winter. &quot;Here I hand you over
our dumb witness&quot;&mdash;and he held out to Furneaux the
blood-soiled ax-head of flint that had battered Rose
de Bercy&#39;s face.</p>

<p class="indent">He was not sure&mdash;he wondered afterwards whether
it was positively a fact&mdash;but he fancied that for the
tenth part of a second Furneaux shrank from taking,
from touching, that object of horror&mdash;a notion
so odd and fantastic that it affected Winter as if
he had fancied that the poker had lifted its head
for the tenth part of a second. But almost before
the conceit took form, Furneaux was coolly placing
the celt in his breast-pocket, and standing up to go.</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux drove straight, as he had said, to Mayfair,
and soon was being ushered into Osborne&#39;s
library, where he found Miss Prout, the secretary,
with her hat on, busy opening and sorting the morning&#39;s
correspondence.</p>

<p class="indent">He introduced himself, sat beside her, and, while
she continued with her work, told her what had happened&mdash;how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
Osborne had been advised to disappear
till the popular gale of ill-will got stilled a little.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, that&#39;s how it was,&quot; the girl said, lifting interested
eyes to his. &quot;I was wondering,&quot; and she
pinned two letters together with the neatness of
method and order.</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux sat lingeringly with her, listening to
an aviary of linnets that prattled to the bright sunlight
that flooded the library, and asking himself
whether he had ever seen hair so glaringly red as
the lady secretary&#39;s&mdash;a great mass of it that wrapped
her head like a flame.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And where has Mr. Osborne gone to?&quot; she murmured,
making a note in shorthand on the back of
one little bundle of correspondence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Somewhere by the coast&mdash;I think,&quot; said Furneaux.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;West coast? East coast?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He didn&#39;t write to me: he wrote to my Chief&quot;&mdash;for,
though Furneaux well knew where Osborne was,
his retreat was a secret.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl went on with her work, plying the paper-knife,
now jotting down a memorandum, now placing
two or more kindred letters together: for every
hospital and institution wrote to Osborne, everyone
who wanted money for a new flying machine, or had
a dog or a hunter to sell, or intended to dine and
speechify, and send round the hat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s quite a large batch of correspondence,&quot; Furneaux
remarked.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
&quot;Half of these,&quot; the girl said, &quot;are letters of
abuse from people who never heard Mr. Osborne&#39;s
name till the day after that poor woman was killed.
All England has convicted him before he is tried.
It seems unfair.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, no doubt. But &#39;to understand is to pardon,&#39;
as the proverb says. They have to think something,
and when there is only one thing for them
to think, they think it&mdash;meaning well. It will blow
over in time. Don&#39;t you worry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I!&mdash;What do I care what forty millions of
vermin choose to say or think?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She pouted her pretty lips saucily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Forty&mdash;millions&mdash;of vermin,&quot; cried Furneaux;
&quot;that&#39;s worse than Carlyle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hylda Prout&#39;s swift hands plied among her papers.
She made no answer; and Furneaux suddenly stood
up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you will mention to the valet and the others
how the matter stands as to Mr. Osborne. He
is simply avoiding the crowd&mdash;that is all. Good-day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hylda Prout rose, too, and Furneaux saw now how
tall she was, well-formed and lithe, with a somewhat
small face framed in that nest of red hair. Her
complexion was spoiled and splashed with freckles,
but otherwise she was dainty-featured and pretty&mdash;mouth,
nose, chin, tiny, all except the wide-open
eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So,&quot; she said to Furneaux as she put out her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
hand, &quot;you won&#39;t let me know where Mr. Osborne
is? I may want to write to him on business.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, didn&#39;t I tell you that he didn&#39;t write to
me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That was only a blind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear me! A blind.... It is the truth, Miss
Prout.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell that to someone else.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What, don&#39;t you like the truth?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right, keep the information to yourself,
then.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-by&mdash;I mustn&#39;t allow myself to dally in
this charming room with the linnets, the sunlight,
and the lady.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For a few seconds she seemed to hesitate. Then
she said suddenly: &quot;Yes, it&#39;s very nice in here. That
door there leads into the morning room, and that
one yonder, at the side&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her voice dropped and stopped; Furneaux appeared
hardly to have heard, or, if hearing, to be
merely making conversation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, it leads where?&quot; he asked, looking at her.
Now, her eyes, too, dropped, and she murmured:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Into the museum.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The&mdash;! Well, naturally, Mr. Osborne is a connoisseur&mdash;quite
so, only I rather expected you to
say &#39;a picture gallery.&#39; Is it&mdash;open to inspection?
Can one&mdash;&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is open, certainly: the door is not locked,
But there&#39;s nothing much&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
&quot;Oh, do let me have a look around, and come with
me, if it will not take long. No one is more interested
in curios than I.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;will, if you like,&quot; said the girl with a strange
note of confidence in her voice, and led the way into
the museum.</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux found himself in a room, small, but
full of riches. On a central table were several illuminated
missals and old Hoch-Deutsch MSS., some
ancient timepieces, and a collection of enameled
watches of Limoges. Around the walls, open or
in cabinets, were arms, blades of Toledo, minerals
arranged on narrow shelves, an embalmed chieftain&#39;s
head from Mexico, and many other bizarre objects.</p>

<p class="indent">Hylda Prout knew the name and history of every
one, and murmured an explanation as Furneaux bent
in scrutiny.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Those are what are called &#39;celts,&#39;&quot; she said;
&quot;they are not very uncommon, and are found in
every country&mdash;made of flint, mostly, and used as
ax-heads by the ancients. These rough ones on this
side are called Palæolithic&mdash;five hundred thousand
years old, some of them; and these finer ones on
this side are Neolithic, not quite so old&mdash;though
there isn&#39;t much to choose in antiquity when it comes
to hundreds of thousands! Strange to say, one of
the Neolithic ones has been missing for some days&mdash;I
don&#39;t know whether Mr. Osborne has given it away
or not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The fact that one <i>was</i> missing was, indeed, quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
obvious, for the celts stood in a row, stuck in holes
drilled in the shelf; and right in the midst of the
rank gaped one empty hole, a dumb little mouth that
yet spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, curious things,&quot; said Furneaux, bending
meditatively over them. &quot;I remember seeing
pictures of them in books. Every one of these
stones is stained with blood.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Blood!&quot; cried the girl in a startled way.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, they were used in war and the chase,
weren&#39;t they? Every one of them has given agony,
every one would be red, if we saw it in its true
color.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Red was also the color of Furneaux&#39;s cheek-bones
at the moment&mdash;red as hectic; and he was conscious
of it, as he was conscious also that his eyes were
wildly alight. Hence, he continued a long time
bending over the &quot;celts&quot; so that Miss Prout might
not see his face. His voice, however, was calm,
since he habitually spoke in jerky, clipped syllables
that betrayed either no emotion or too much.</p>

<p class="indent">When he turned round, it was to move straight to
a little rack on the left, in which glittered a fine
array of daggers&mdash;Japanese kokatanas, punals of
Salamanca, cangiars of Morocco, bowie-knives of old
California, some with squat blades, coming quickly to
a point, some long and thin to transfix the body,
others meant to cut and gash, each with its label
of minute writing.</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux&#39;s eye had duly noted them before, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
he had passed them without stopping. Now, after
seeing the celts, he went back to them.</p>

<p class="indent">To his surprise, Miss Prout did not come with
him. She stood looking on the ground, her lower
lip somewhat protruded, silent, obviously distrait.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And these, Miss Prout?&quot; chirped he, &quot;are they
of high value?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She neither answered nor moved.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps you haven&#39;t studied their history?&quot;
ventured Furneaux again.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, all at once, she moved to the rack of daggers,
and without saying a word, tapped with the
fore-finger of her right hand, and kept on tapping, a
vacant hole in the rack, though her eyes peered
deeply into Furneaux&#39;s face. And for the first time
Furneaux made acquaintance with the real splendor
of her eyes&mdash;eyes that lived in sleep, torpid like the
dormouse; but when they woke, woke to such a lambency
of passion that they fascinated and commanded
like the basilisk&#39;s.</p>

<p class="indent">With eyes so alight she now kept peering at Furneaux,
standing tall above him, tapping at the empty
hole.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I see,&quot; muttered Furneaux, <i>his</i> eyes, too,
alight like live coals, &quot;there&#39;s an article missing here,
also&mdash;one from the celts, one from the daggers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is innocent!&quot; suddenly cried Hylda Prout,
in a tempest of passionate reproach.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She loves him,&quot; thought Furneaux.</p>

<p class="indent">And the girl thought: &quot;He knew before now that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
these things were missing. His acting would deceive
every man, but not every woman. How glad I am
that I drew him on!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Now, though the fact of the discovery of the celt
by Inspector Clarke under the dead actress&#39;s piano
had not been published in the papers, the fact that
she had been stabbed through the eye by a long
blade with blunt edges was known to all the world.
There was nothing strange in this fierce outburst
of Osborne&#39;s trusted secretary, nor that tears should
spring to her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Furneaux, he is innocent,&quot; she wailed in a
frenzy. &quot;Oh, he is! You noticed me hesitate just
now to bring you in here: well, <i>this</i> was the reason&mdash;this,
this, this&mdash;&mdash;&quot; she tapped with her forefinger
on the empty hole&mdash;&quot;for I knew that you would see
this, and I knew that you would be jumping to some
terrible conclusion as to Mr. Osborne.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Conclusion, no,&quot; murmured Furneaux comfortingly&mdash;&quot;I
avoid conclusions as traps for the unwary.
Interesting, of course, that&#39;s all. Tell me
what you know, and fear nothing. Conclusion, you
say! I don&#39;t jump to conclusions. Tell me what
was the shape of the dagger that has disappeared.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was silent again for many seconds. She was
wrung with doubt, whether to speak or not to speak.</p>

<p class="indent">At last she voiced her agony.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Either I must refuse to say, or I must tell the
truth&mdash;and if I tell the truth, you will think&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She stopped again, all her repose of manner fled.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
&quot;You don&#39;t know what I will think,&quot; put in Furneaux.
&quot;Sometimes I think the most unexpected
things. The best way is to give me the plain facts.
The question is, whether the blade that has gone
from there was shaped like the one supposed to have
committed the crime in the flat?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was labeled &#39;Saracen Stiletto: about 1150,&#39;&quot;
muttered the girl brokenly, looking Furneaux
straight in the face, though the fire was now dead
in her eyes. &quot;It had a square bone handle, with
a crescent carved on one of the four faces&mdash;a longish,
thin blade, like a skewer, only not round&mdash;with
blunt-edged corners to it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux took up a little tube containing radium
from a table at his hand, looked at it, and put it
down again.</p>

<p class="indent">Hylda Prout was too distraught to see that his
hand shook a little. It was half a minute before
he spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, all that proves nothing, though it is of
interest, of course,&quot; he said nonchalantly. &quot;How
long has that stiletto been lying there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Since&mdash;since I entered Mr. Osborne&#39;s employment,
twelve months ago.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you first noticed that it was gone&mdash;when?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On the second afternoon after the murder, when
I noticed that the celt, too, was gone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The second&mdash;I see.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wondered what had become of them! I could
imagine that Mr. Osborne might have given the celt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
to some friend. But the stiletto was so rare a
thing&mdash;I couldn&#39;t think that he would give that. I
assumed&mdash;I assume&mdash;that they were stolen. But,
then, by whom?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s the question,&quot; said Furneaux.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was it this same stiletto that I have described
to you that the murder was done with?&quot; asked
Hylda.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, how can I tell that?&quot; said Furneaux. &quot;<i>I</i>
wasn&#39;t there, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was not the weapon, then, found in the unfortunate
woman&#39;s flat?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No&mdash;no weapon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, but that is excessively odd,&quot; she said in
a low voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why so excessively odd?&quot; demanded Furneaux.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why? Because&mdash;don&#39;t you see?&mdash;the weapon
would be blood-stained&mdash;of course; and I should expect
that after committing his horrid deed, the murderer
would be only too glad to get rid of it, and
would leave it&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, come, that is hardly a good guess, Miss
Prout. I shall never make a lady detective of you.
Murderers don&#39;t leave their weapons about behind
them, for weapons are clews, you see.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was well aware that if the fact of the discovery
of the celt had been published in the papers, Hylda
might justly have answered: &quot;But <i>this</i> murderer did
leave <i>one</i> of his weapons behind, namely the celt;
and it is excessively odd that, since he left one, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
smaller one, he did not leave the other, the larger
one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As it was, the girl took thought, and her comment
was shrewd enough:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All murderers do not act in the same way, for
some are a world more cunning and alert than others.
I say that it <i>is</i> odd that the murderer did not leave
behind the weapon that pierced the woman&#39;s eye,
and I will prove it to you. If the stiletto was
stolen from Mr. Osborne&mdash;and it really must have
been stolen&mdash;and if that was the same stiletto that
the deed was done with, then, the motive of the thief
in stealing it was to kill Mademoiselle de Bercy with
it. But why should one steal a weapon to commit
a murder? And why should the murderer have
chosen <i>Mr. Osborne</i> to steal his weapon from? Obviously,
because he wanted to throw the suspicion
upon him&mdash;in which case he would <i>naturally</i> leave
the weapon behind as proof of Mr. Osborne&#39;s guilt.
Now, then, have I proved my point?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Though she spoke almost in italics, and was pale
and flurried, she looked jauntily at Furneaux, with
her head tossed back; and he, with half a smile,
answered:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I withdraw my remark as to your detective qualifications,
Miss Prout. Yes, I think you reason well.
If there was a thief, and the thief was the murderer,
he would very likely have acted as you say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then, why was the stiletto not found in the
flat?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
&quot;The fact that it was not found would seem to
show that there was <i>not</i> a thief,&quot; he said; and he
added quickly: &quot;Perhaps Mr. Osborne gave it, as
well as the celt, to someone. I suppose you asked
him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was gone away an hour before I missed
them,&quot; Hylda answered. She hesitated again.
When next she spoke it was with a smile that would
have won a stone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me where he is,&quot; she pleaded, &quot;and I will
write to him about it. You may safely tell <i>me</i>,
you know, for Mr. Osborne has no secrets from
<i>me</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish I could tell you.... Oh, but he will
soon be back again, and then you will see him and
speak to him once more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Some tone of badinage in these jerky sentences
brought a flush to her face, but she tried to ward off
his scrutiny with a commonplace remark.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, that&#39;s some consolation. I must wait in
patience till the mob finds a new sensation.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux took a turn through the room, silently
meditating.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thanks so much for your courtesy, Miss Prout,&quot;
he said at last. &quot;Our conversation has been&mdash;fruitful.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, fruitful in throwing still more suspicion
upon an innocent man, if that is what you mean.
Are not the police <i>quite</i> convinced yet of Mr. Osborne&#39;s
innocence, Inspector Furneaux?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
&quot;Oh, quite, quite,&quot; said he hastily, somewhat taken
aback by her candor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Two &#39;quites&#39; make a &#39;not quite,&#39; as two negatives
make an affirmative,&quot; said she coldly, fingering
and looking down at some wistaria in her bosom.</p>

<p class="indent">She added with sudden warmth: &quot;Oh, but you
should, Inspector Furneaux! You should. He has
suffered; his honest and true heart has been wounded.
And he has his alibi, which, though in reality it
may not be so good as you think, is yet quite good
enough. But I know what it is that poisons your
mind against him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are full of statements, Miss Prout,&quot; said
Furneaux with an inclination of the head; &quot;what is
it, now, that poisons my mind against that gentleman?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is that taxicabman&#39;s delusion that he took
him from the Ritz Hotel to Feldisham Mansions
and back, added to the housekeeper&#39;s delusion that
she saw him here&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux nearly gasped. Up to that moment
he had heard no word about a housekeeper&#39;s delusion,
or of a housekeeper&#39;s existence even. A long
second passed before he could answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, she was no doubt mistaken. I have not
yet examined her personally, but I have every reason
to believe that she is in error. At what hour, by
the way, does she say that she thought she saw
him here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>She</i> says she thinks it was about five minutes to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
eight. But at that time, I take it from the evidence,
he must have been writing those two letters at the
Ritz. If she were right, that would make out that
after doing the deed at about 7.40 or so, he would
just have time to come back here by five to eight,
and change his clothes. But he was at the Ritz&mdash;he
was at the Ritz! And Mrs. Bates only saw his
back an instant going up the stairs&mdash;his ghost&#39;s
back, she means, his double&#39;s back, not his own.
He was at the Ritz, Inspector Furneaux.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Precisely,&quot; said Furneaux, with a voice that at
last had a quiver in it. &quot;If any fact is clear in
a maze of doubt, that, at least, is established beyond
cavil. And Mrs. Bates&#39;s other name&mdash;I&mdash;forget
it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hester.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s it. Is she here now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is taking a holiday to-day. She was dreadfully
upset.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thanks. Good-by.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He held out his hand a second time, quite affably.
Hylda Prout followed him out to the library and,
when the street door had closed behind him, peeped
through the curtains at his alert, natty figure as he
hastened away.</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux took a motor-bus to Whitehall, and,
what was very odd, the &#39;bus carried him beyond his
destination, over Westminster Bridge, indeed, he
was so lost in meditation.</p>

<p class="indent">His object now was to see Winter and fling at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
his chief&#39;s head some of the amazing things he had
just learned.</p>

<p class="indent">But when he arrived at Scotland Yard, Winter
was not there. At that moment, in fact, Winter
was at Osborne&#39;s house in Mayfair, whither he had
rushed to meet Furneaux in order to whisper to Furneaux
without a moment&#39;s delay some news just
gleaned by the merest chance&mdash;the news that Pauline
Dessaulx, Rose de Bercy&#39;s maid, had quarreled
with her mistress on the morning of the murder,
and had been given notice to quit Miss de Bercy&#39;s
service.</p>

<p class="indent">When Winter arrived at Osborne&#39;s house Furneaux,
of course, was gone. To his question at the
door, &quot;Is Mr. Furneaux here?&quot; the parlor-maid answered:
&quot;I am not sure, sir&mdash;I&#39;ll see.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps you don&#39;t know Mr. Furneaux,&quot; said
Winter, &quot;a small-built gentleman&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, sir, I know him,&quot; the girl answered.
&quot;I let him in this morning, as well as when he called
some days ago.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">No words in the English tongue could have more
astonished Winter, for Furneaux had not mentioned
to him that he had even been to Osborne&#39;s. What
Furneaux could have been doing there &quot;some days
ago&quot; was beyond his guessing. Before his wonderment
could get out another question, the girl was
leading the way towards the library.</p>

<p class="indent">In the library were Miss Prout, writing, and
Jenkins handing her a letter.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
&quot;I came to see if Inspector Furneaux was here,&quot;
Winter said; &quot;but evidently he has gone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only about three minutes,&quot; said Hylda Prout,
throwing a quick look round at him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thanks&mdash;I am sorry to have troubled you,&quot;
he said. Then he added, to Jenkins: &quot;Much obliged
for the cigars!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do not mention it, sir,&quot; said Jenkins.</p>

<p class="indent">Winter had reached the library door, when he
stopped short.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By the way, Jenkins, is this Mr. Furneaux&#39;s first
visit here?&mdash;or don&#39;t you remember?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Furneaux came here once before, sir,&quot; said
Jenkins in his staid official way.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, I thought perhaps&mdash;when was that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let me see, sir. It was&mdash;yes&mdash;on the third,
the afternoon of the murder, I remember.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The third&mdash;the afternoon of the murder. Those
words ate their way into Winter&#39;s very brain. They
might have been fired from a pistol rather than uttered
by the placid Jenkins.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The afternoon, you say,&quot; repeated Winter.
&quot;Yes&mdash;quite so; he wished to see Mr. Osborne. At
what exact <i>hour</i> about would that be?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jenkins again meditated. Then he said: &quot;Mr.
Furneaux called, sir, about 5.45, as far as I can
recollect. He wished to see my master, who was
out, but was expected to return. So Mr. Furneaux
was shown in here to await him, and he waited a
quarter of an hour, if I am right in saying that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
he came at 5.45, because Mr. Osborne telephoned me
from Feldisham Mansions that he would not be returning,
and as I entered the museum there, where
Mr. Furneaux then was, to tell him, I heard the
clock strike six, I remember.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At this Hylda Prout whirled round in her chair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The museum!&quot; she cried. &quot;How odd, how
exceedingly odd! Just now Mr. Furneaux seemed
to be rather surprised when I told him that there
was a museum!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He doubtless forgot, miss,&quot; said Jenkins, &quot;for
he had certainly gone in there when I entered the
library.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thanks, thanks,&quot; said Winter lightly, &quot;that&#39;s
how it was&mdash;good-day&quot;; and he went out with the
vacant air of a man who has lost something, but
knows not what.</p>

<p class="indent">He drove straight to Scotland Yard. There in
the office sat Furneaux.</p>

<p class="indent">For a long time they conferred&mdash;Winter with
hardly a word, one hand on his thigh, the other at
his mustache, looking at Furneaux with a frown, with
curious musing eyes, meditating, silent. And Furneaux
told how the celt and the stiletto were missing
from Osborne&#39;s museum.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And the inference?&quot; said Winter, speaking at
last, his round eyes staring widely at Furneaux.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The inference, on the face of it, is that Osborne
is guilty,&quot; said Furneaux quietly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An innocent man, Furneaux?&quot; said Winter almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
with a groan of reproach&mdash;&quot;an innocent
man?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux&#39;s eyes flashed angrily an instant, and
some word leapt to his lips, but it was not uttered.
He stood up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, that&#39;s how it stands for the moment. Time
will show&mdash;I must be away,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">And when he had gone out, Winter rose wearily,
and paced with slow steps a long time through the
room, his head bent quite down, staring. Presently
he came upon a broken cigar, such as Furneaux
delighted in smelling. Then a fierce cry broke from
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Furneaux, my friend! Why, this is madness!
Oh, d&mdash;n everything!&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br/>
TO TORMOUTH</h2>

<p class="indent">&quot;An absinthe!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A packet of Caporal!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Un bock pour vous, m&#39;sieur?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A vodka!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A frowsy waiter was hurrying through some such
jangle of loud voices from the &quot;comrades&quot; scattered
among the tables set in a back room in a very
back street of Soho. The hour was two in the morning,
and the light in that Anarchist Club was murky
and blurred. Only one gas-jet on the wall lit the
room, and that struggled but feebly through the
cigarette smoke that choked the air like a fog&mdash;air
that was foul and close as well as dim, for some thirty
persons, mostly men but some few women, were
crowded in there as if there was no place else on
earth for them.</p>

<p class="indent">One heard the rattle of dice, the whirr of cards
being shuffled against the thumbs, the grating of
glass tumblers against imitation granite. Two poor
girls, cramped in a corner, were attempting to dance
to the rhythm of an Italian song. They were laughing
with wide mouths, their heads thrown back,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
weary unto death, yet alive with make-believe mirth.</p>

<p class="indent">At one of the tables sat Gaston Janoc, the man
who had been seen by Inspector Clarke talking in
St. Martin&#39;s Lane to Bertha Seward, one-time cook
in the Feldisham Mansions flat. Playing vingt-et-un
with him was a burly Russian-looking man, all red
beard and eyebrows; also a small Frenchman with an
imperial and a crooked nose; while a colored man
of Martinique made the fourth of a queer quartette.
But somehow Janoc and the rough, red Russian
seemed not to be able to agree in the game. They
were antagonistic as cat and dog, and three times
one or other threw down his cards and looked at his
adversary, as who should say:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A little more of you, and my knife talks!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who are you, then, Ruski?&quot; cried Janoc at last,
speaking French, since the Russian only glared at
him when he swore in his quaint English.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet the Russian grumbled in English in his beard:
&quot;No French.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And no Italian, and no Spanish, and no German,
and very, very small English,&quot; growled Janoc in
English, frowning at him; &quot;Well, then, shall we converse,
sare?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is that&mdash;&#39;<i>converse</i>&#39;?&quot; asked the Russian.</p>

<p class="indent">Janoc shrugged disgustedly, while the little
Frenchman, whose eyes twinkled at every tiff between
the pair, said politely in French:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We await your play, m&#39;sieurs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Twice, on the very edge of the precipice of open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
hostilities, Janoc and the Russian stopped short;
but a little after two o&#39;clock, when much absinthe
and vodka had been drunk, an outbreak took place:
for the Russian then cried out loudly above the hubbub
of tongues:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you&mdash;how you call it?&mdash;<i>tcheeeet</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who? I&mdash;me?&quot; cried Janoc sharply, pale,
half-standing&mdash;&quot;cheat?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes&mdash;<i>tcheeet</i>, you <i>tcheeet</i>!&quot; insisted the bearded
Slav. And now the little Frenchman with the crooked
nose, who foreknew that the table was about to be
upset, stood up quickly, picked up his thimbleful of
anisette, and holding it in hand, awaited with merry
eyes the outcome.</p>

<p class="indent">Instantly Janoc, who was dealing, sent the pack
of cards like an assault of birds into the Russian&#39;s
face, the Russian closed with Janoc, and forthwith
the room reeled into chaos. The struggle need not
be described. Suffice it to say, that it lasted longer
than the Russian had probably expected, for Janoc
proved to have sinews of steel, though thin steel.
His lank arms embraced the Russian, squeezing like
a cable that is being tighter and tighter wound.
However, he was overcome by mere weight, thumping
to the floor among a tumbled dance of tables, chairs,
and foreign drinks, while the women shrieked, the
men bellowed, and the scared manager of the den
added to the uproar by yelling:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;M&#39;sieurs! M&#39;sieurs! Je vous prie! The police
will come!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
Only one soul in the room remained calm, and
that was the diminutive Frenchman, who kept dodging
through the legs and arms of the flood of humanity
that surged around the two on the floor.</p>

<p class="indent">He alone of them all saw that the Russian, in the
thick of the struggle, was slipping his hand into
pocket after pocket of Janoc under him, and was very
deftly drawing out any papers that he might find
there.</p>

<p class="indent">In two minutes the row was ended, and the gaming
and drinking recommenced as if nothing had happened.
The Russian had been half led, half hustled
to the front door, and was gone. Immediately after
him had slipped out the bright-eyed Frenchman.</p>

<p class="indent">The Russian, after pacing down an alley, turned
into Old Compton Street, twice peering about and
behind him, as if disturbed by some instinct that he
was being shadowed. And this was so&mdash;but with
a skill so nimble, so expert, so inbred, did the Frenchman
follow, that in this pursuit the true meaning of
the word &quot;shadowing&quot; was realized. The Russian
did not see his follower for the excellent reason that
the Frenchman made himself an invisibility. He
might have put on those magic shoes that shadows
shoot and dash and slink in, so airily did he glide on
the trail. Nor could mere genius have accomplished
such a feat, and with such ease&mdash;were it not for the
expertness that was wedded to genius.</p>

<p class="indent">When the Russian emerged into the wide thoroughfare
close to the Palace Theater, he stood under a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
lamp to look at one of the papers picked from
Janoc&#39;s pockets; and only then did he become aware
of the Frenchman, who rose up out of the ground
under his elbow with that pert ease with which a
cork bobs to the surface of water.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Got anything of importance?&quot; asked the Frenchman,
his twinkling eyes radiant with the humor of
the chase.</p>

<p class="indent">The Russian stared at him half a minute with the
hung jaw of astonishment. Then, all at once remembering
his rôle, he cried hoarsely:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No English!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, chuck it!&quot; remarked the other.</p>

<p class="indent">Again the Russian gazed at the unexpected little
phenomenon, and his voice rumbled:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is that&mdash;&#39;chuck it&#39;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly the Frenchman snatched Janoc&#39;s paper
neatly with thumb and finger out of the Russian&#39;s
hand, and ran chuckling across Charing Cross Road
eastward. The Russian, with a grunt of rage, made
after him with his long legs. But, from the first,
he saw that he was being left behind by the nimble
pace set up by a good runner. He seemed to understand
that a miracle was needed, and lo, it occurred,
for, as the two crossed the road in front of the Palace
Theater, the Russian lifted his voice into:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stop him! Stop thief! Police! Police!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Not only did he yell in most lucid English, but
he also plucked a police whistle from his coat and
blew it loudly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
No policeman happened to be near, however, and
the deep sleep of London echoed their pelting steps
eastward, until the Russian saw the paper-snatcher
vanish from sight in the congeries of streets that
converge on the top of St. Martin&#39;s Lane.</p>

<p class="indent">He lost hope then, and slackened a little, panting
but swearing in a language that would be appreciated
by any London cabman. Nevertheless, when
he, too, ran into St. Martin&#39;s Lane, there was the
small Frenchman, standing, wiping his forehead,
awaiting him.</p>

<p class="indent">The Russian sprang at him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You little whelp!&quot; he roared. &quot;I arrest
you&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, what&#39;s the good, Clarke? You are slow this
evening. I just thought I&#39;d wake you up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Furneaux!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fancy not knowing me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was <i>you</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who else? Here&#39;s your Janocy document. You
might let me have a look at it. Share and share
alike.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Clarke tried to retrieve lost prestige, though his
hand shook as he took the paper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well&mdash;I&mdash;could have sworn it was you!&quot; he
said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course you could&mdash;and did, no doubt. Let&#39;s
have a glimpse at those documents.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But what were <i>you</i> doing in the Fraternal Club,
anyhow? Something on in that line?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
&quot;No. An idle hour. Chance of picking up a
stray clew. I sometimes do dive into those depths
without special object. You managed that to a T
with Janoc. Where are the other papers? Hand
them over.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;With pleasure,&quot; said Clarke, but there was no
pleasure in his surly Russian face, in which rage
shone notwithstanding a marvelous make-up. Still,
he opened the paper under the lamp&mdash;a sheet of
notepaper with some lines of writing on the first
page; and on the top of it, printed, the name of a
hotel, &quot;The Swan, Tormouth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The two detectives peered over it. To the illimitable
surprise of both, this letter, stolen by
Clarke from Janoc&#39;s pocket, was addressed to Clarke
himself&mdash;a letter from Rupert Osborne, the millionaire.</p>

<p class="indent">And Osborne said in it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Dear Inspector Clarke</span>:&mdash;Yours of the 7th duly to hand.
In reply to your inquiry, I am not aware that the late Mlle.
Rose de Bercy had any relations with Anarchists, either in
London or in Paris, other than those which have been mentioned
in the papers&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, a purely professional interest for
stage purposes. I think it unlikely that her connection with
them extended further.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I am,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Sincerely yours,</span><br />
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Rupert Osborne</span>.</span><br />
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Furneaux and Clarke looked at each other in a
blank bewilderment that was not assumed by either
man.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
&quot;<i>Did</i> you write to Mr. Osborne, asking that question?&quot;
asked Furneaux.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Clarke&mdash;&quot;never. I didn&#39;t even know
where Osborne was.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So Janoc must have written to him in your
name?&quot; said Furneaux. &quot;Janoc, then, wishes to
know how much information Osborne can give you
as to Mademoiselle de Bercy&#39;s association with Anarchists.
That seems clear. But why should Janoc
think that <i>you</i> particularly are interested in knowing?</p>

<p class="indent">Clarke flushed hotly under the paint, being conscious
that he was investigating the case on his own
private account and in a secret way. As a matter
of fact, he was by this time fully convinced that
Rose de Bercy&#39;s murder was the work of Anarchist
hands, but he was so vexed with Furneaux&#39;s tricking
him, and so fearful of official reprimand from Winter
that he only answered:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why Janoc should think that I am interested,
I can&#39;t imagine. It beats me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And how can Janoc know where Osborne is, or
his assumed name, to write to him?&quot; muttered Furneaux.
&quot;I thought that that was a secret between
Osborne, Winter, and myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Clarke, equally puzzled, scratched his head under
his wig, which had been insufferably hot in that
stifling room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Janoc and his crew must be keeping an eye on
Osborne, it seems&mdash;for some reason,&quot; he exclaimed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
&quot;Heaven knows why&mdash;I don&#39;t. I am out of the
de Bercy case, of course. My interest in the Janoc
crowd is&mdash;political.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let me see the letter again,&quot; said Furneaux;
and he read it carefully once more. Then he opened
the sheet, as if seeking additional information from
the blank pages, turned it over, looked at the back&mdash;and
there at the back he saw something else that
was astounding, for, written backwards, near the
bottom of the page, in Osborne&#39;s handwriting, was
the word &quot;Rosalind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is &#39;Rosalind&#39;?&quot; asked Furneaux&mdash;&quot;see
here, an impression from some other letter written
at the same time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t know, I&#39;m sure,&quot; said Clarke. &quot;A sister,
perhaps.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A sister. Why, though, should his sister&#39;s name
appear at the back of a note written to Janoc, or
to Inspector Clarke, as he thought?&quot; said Furneaux
to himself, deep in meditation. He suddenly added
brightly: &quot;Now, Clarke, there&#39;s a puzzle for you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t see it, see any puzzle, I mean. It might
have appeared on any other letter, say to his bankers,
or to a friend. It was a mere accident. There
is nothing in that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite right,&quot; grinned Furneaux. &quot;And it was
a sister&#39;s name, of course. &#39;Rosalind.&#39; A pretty
name. Poor girl, she will be anxious about her fond
and doting brother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It may be another woman&#39;s name,&quot; said Clarke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
sagely&mdash;&quot;though, for that matter, he&#39;d hardly be
on with a new love before the other one is cold in
her grave, as the saying is.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux laughed a low, mysterious laugh in his
throat. It had a peculiar sound, and rang hard and
bitter in the ears of the other.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll keep this, if you don&#39;t mind,&quot; he said, lapsing
into the detective again.</p>

<p class="indent">Meantime, Furneaux knew that there were other
papers of Janoc&#39;s in Clarke&#39;s pocket, and he lingered
a little to give his colleague a chance of exhibiting
them. Clarke made no move, however, so he put out
his hand, saying, &quot;Well, good luck,&quot; and disappeared
southward, while Clarke walked northward toward
his residence, Hampstead way. But in Southampton
Row an overwhelming impatience to see the other
Janoc papers overcame him, and he commenced to
examine them as he went.</p>

<p class="indent">Two were bills. A third was a newspaper cutting
from the <i>Matin</i> commenting on the murder in Feldisham
Mansions. The fourth had power to arrest
Clarke&#39;s steps. It was a letter of three closely-written
pages&mdash;in French; and though Clarke&#39;s
French, self-taught, was not fluent, it could walk, if
it could not fly. In ten minutes he had read and
understood....</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">St. Petersburg says that since the secret meeting, a steady
growth of courage in the rank-and-file is observable. As for
the Nevski funds, an individual highly placed, whose name
is in three syllables, is said to be willing to come to the rescue.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
Lastly, as to the traitress, you will see to it that she to whose
hands vengeance has been intrusted shall fail on the 3rd.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">This was in the letter; and as Inspector Clarke&#39;s
eyes fell on the date, &quot;the 3d,&quot; his clenched hand
rose triumphantly in air. It was on July <i>the 3d</i>
that Rose de Bercy had been done to death!</p>

<p class="indent">When Clarke again walked onward his eyes were
alight with a wild exultation. He was thinking:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, Allah be praised, that I didn&#39;t show Furneaux
this thing, as I nearly was doing!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He reached his house with a sense of surprise&mdash;he
had covered so much ground unconsciously, and
the dominant thought in his mind was that the race
was not always to the swift.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Luck is the thing in a man&#39;s career,&quot; he said to
himself, &quot;not wit, or mere sharpness to grasp a
point. Slow, and steady, and lucky&mdash;that&#39;s the combination.
The British are a race slower of thought
than some of the others, just as <i>I</i> may be a slower
man than Furneaux, but we Britons rule the world
by luck, as we won the battle of Waterloo by luck.
Luck and prime beef, they go together somehow, I
do believe. And what I am to-day I owe to luck,
for it&#39;s happened to me too often to doubt that I&#39;ve
got the gift of it in my marrow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He put his latch-key into the door with something
of a smile; and the next morning Mrs. Clarke cried
delightedly to him:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, something must have happened to put you
in this good temper!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
At that same hour of the morning Furneaux, for
his part, was at Osborne&#39;s house in Mayfair, where
he had an appointment with Mrs. Hester Bates, Osborne&#39;s
housekeeper. He was just being admitted
into the house when the secretary, Miss Prout, walked
up to the door&mdash;rather to his surprise, for it was
somewhat before the hour of a secretary&#39;s attendance.
They entered together and passed into the
library, where Hylda Prout invited him to sit down
for a minute.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am only here just to collect and answer
the morning&#39;s letters,&quot; she explained pleasantly.
&quot;There&#39;s a tree which I know in Epping Forest&mdash;an
old beech&mdash;where I&#39;m taking a book to read. See
my picnic basket?&mdash;tomato and cress sandwiches,
half a bottle of Chianti, an aluminum folding cup
to drink from. I&#39;ll send for Mrs. Bates in a moment,
and leave her to your tender inquiries. But
wouldn&#39;t you prefer Epping Forest on a day like
this? Do you like solitude, Inspector Furneaux?
Dreams?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I like solitude, as boys like piracy, because
unattainable. I can only just find time to sleep,
but not time enough to dream.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hylda lifted her face beatifically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I <i>love</i> to dream!&mdash;to be with myself&mdash;alone: the
world in one compartment, I in another, with myself;
with silence to hear my heart beat in, and time
to fathom a little what its beating is madly trying
to say; an old tree overhead, and breezes breathing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
through it. Oh, <i>they</i> know how to soothe; <i>they</i> alone
understand, Inspector Furneaux, and <i>they</i> forgive.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux said within himself: &quot;Well, I seem to
be in for some charming confidences&quot;; and he added
aloud: &quot;Quite so; <i>they</i> understand&mdash;if it&#39;s a lady:
for Nature is feminine; and only a lady can fathom
a lady.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, women!&quot; Hylda said, with her pretty pout
of disdain,&mdash;&quot;they are nothing, mostly shallow shoppers.
Give me a man&mdash;if he is a man. And there
have been a few women, too&mdash;in history. But, man
or woman, what I believe is that for the greater part,
we remain foreigners to ourselves through life&mdash;we
never reach that depth in ourselves, &#39;deeper than
ever plummet sounded,&#39; where the real <i>I</i> within us
lives, the real, bare-faced, rabid, savage, divine <i>I</i>,
naked as an ape, contorted, sobbing, bawling what
it cannot speak.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux, who had certainly not suspected this
blend of philosopher and poet beneath that mass of
red hair, listened in silence. For the second time
he saw this strange girl&#39;s eyes take fire, glow, rage
a moment like a building sweltering in conflagration,
and then die down to utter dullness.</p>

<p class="indent">Though he knew just when to speak, his reply was
rather tame.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s something in that, too&mdash;you are right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She suddenly smiled, with a pretty air of confusion.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
&quot;Surely,&quot; she said. &quot;And now to business: first,
Mrs. Bates&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One moment,&quot; broke in Furneaux. &quot;Something
has caused me to wish to ask you&mdash;do you know Mr.
Osborne&#39;s relatives?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know <i>of</i> them. He has only a younger brother,
Ralph, who is at Harvard University&mdash;and an
aunt.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aunt&#39;s name Rosalind?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No&mdash;Priscilla&mdash;Priscilla Emptage.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who, then, may &#39;Rosalind&#39; be?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No connection of <i>his</i>. You must have made
some mistake.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux held out the note of Rupert Osborne to
Janoc intended for Clarke, holding it so folded that
the name of the hotel was not visible&mdash;only the transferred
word &quot;Rosalind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And as Hylda Prout bent over it, perplexed at
first by the seeming scrawl, Furneaux&#39;s eye was on
her face. He was aware of the instant when she
recognized the handwriting, the instant when reasoning
and the putting of two-and-two together began
to work in her mind, the instant when her stare began
to widen, and her tight-pressed lips to relax,
the rush of color to fade from her face, and the
mask of freckles to stand out darkly in strong contrast
with her ivory white flesh. When she had
stared for a long minute, and had had enough, she
did not say anything, but turned away silently to
stand at a window, her back to Furneaux.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
He looked at her, thinking: &quot;She guesses, and
suffers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly she whirled round. &quot;May I&mdash;see that
letter?&quot; she asked in a low voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The whole note?&quot; he said; &quot;I&#39;m afraid that it&#39;s
private&mdash;not <i>my</i> secret&mdash;I regret it&mdash;an official
document, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;You may come
to me for help yet&quot;&mdash;and turned to the pile of letters
on the desk.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anyway, Rosalind is not a relative, to your
knowledge?&quot; he persisted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She stuffed the letters into a drawer, bowed, and
was gone, leaving him sorry for her, for he saw
a lump working in her throat.</p>

<p class="indent">Some minutes after her disappearance, a plump
little woman came in&mdash;Mrs. Hester Bates, housekeeper
in the Osborne <i>ménage</i>. Her hair lay in
smooth curves on her brow as on the upturned bulge
of a china bowl. There was an apprehensive look
in her upward-looking eyes, so Furneaux spoke comfortingly
to her, after seating her near the window.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid to speak,&quot; he said reassuringly.
&quot;What you have to say is not necessarily against
Mr. Osborne&#39;s interests. Just state the facts simply&mdash;you
did see him here on the murder night, didn&#39;t
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She muttered something, as a tear dropped on
the ample bosom of her black dress.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
&quot;Just a little louder,&quot; Furneaux said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; she sobbed, &quot;I saw his back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You were&mdash;where?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Coming up the kitchen stairs to talk to Mr.
Jenkins.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t cry. And when you reached the top of
the kitchen stairs you saw his back on the house
stairs&mdash;at the bottom? at the top?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was nearer the top. I only saw him a
minute.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A moment, you mean, I think. And in that
one moment you became quite sure that it was Mr.
Osborne? Though it was only his back you
saw?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, sir....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, don&#39;t cry. It&#39;s nothing. Only are you
certain sure&mdash;that&#39;s the point?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I am sure enough, but&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought he was the worse for drink, which
was a mad thing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you thought that. Why so?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;His feet seemed to reel from side to side&mdash;almost
from under him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;His feet&mdash;I see. From side to side.... Ever
saw him the worse for drink before?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never in all my life! I was amazed. Afterwards
I had a feeling that it wasn&#39;t Mr. Osborne
himself, but his spirit that I had seen. And it may
have been his spirit! For my Aunt Pruie saw the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
spirit of her boy one Sunday afternoon when he was
alive and well in his ship on the sea.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But a spirit the worse for drink?&quot; murmured
Furneaux; &quot;a spirit whose feet seemed to reel?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She dropped her eyes, and presently wept a theory.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A spirit walks lighter-like than a Christian, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you, though,&quot; asked Furneaux, making
shorthand signs in his notebook, &quot;did you have the
impression that it might be a spirit at the time, or
was it only afterwards?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was only afterwards when I thought matters
over,&quot; said Mrs. Bates. &quot;Even at the time it crossed
my mind that there was something in it I didn&#39;t
rightly understand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, what sort of something?&mdash;can&#39;t you say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, sir. I don&#39;t know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And when you saw Mr. Jenkins immediately
afterwards, did you mention to him that you had
seen Mr. Osborne?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I didn&#39;t say anything to him, nor him to
me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pity.... But the hour. You have said, I
hear, that it was five minutes to eight. Now, the
murder was committed between 7.30 and 7.45; and
at five to eight Mr. Osborne is said by more than
one person to have been at the Ritz Hotel. If he
was there, he couldn&#39;t have been here. If he was
here, he couldn&#39;t have been there. Are you sure of
the hour&mdash;five to eight?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As to that Mrs. Bates was positive. She had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
reason to remember, having looked at the clock
<i>à propos</i> of the servants&#39; supper. And Furneaux
went away from her with eyes in which sparkled a
light that some might have called wicked, and all
would have called cruel, as when the cat hears a
stirring, and crouches at the hole&#39;s rim with her
soul crowded into an unblinking stare of expectation.</p>

<p class="indent">He looked at his watch, took a cab to Waterloo,
and while in the vehicle again studied that scrawled
&quot;Rosalind&quot; on Osborne&#39;s letter to Janoc.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A trip to Tormouth should throw some light on
it,&quot; he thought. &quot;If it can be shown that he is
actually in love&mdash;again&mdash;already&mdash;&mdash;&quot; and as he so
thought, the cab ran out of St. James&#39;s Street into
Pall Mall.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look! quick! There&mdash;in that cab!&quot; hissed
a man at that moment to a girl with whom
he was lurking in a doorway deep under the shadow
of an awning near the corner. &quot;Look!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s him!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sure? Look well!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The very man!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, of all the fatalities!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The cab dashed out of sight, and the man&mdash;Chief
Inspector Winter&mdash;clapped his hand to his forehead
in a spasm of sheer distraction and dismay. The
woman with him was the murdered actress&#39;s cook,
Bertha Seward, the same whom Inspector Clarke had
one morning seen in earnest talk with Janoc under
the pawnbroker&#39;s sign in St. Martin&#39;s Lane.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
Winter walked away from her, looking on the
ground, seeking his lost wits there. Then suddenly
he turned and overtook her again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you swear to me, Miss Seward,&quot; he said
gravely, &quot;that that very man was with your mistress
in her flat on the evening of the murder?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I would know him anywhere,&quot; answered the
slight girl, looking up into his face with her oblique
Chinese eyes that were always half shut as if shy
of light. &quot;I thought to myself at the time what
a queer, perky person he was, and what working eyes
the little man had, and I wondered who he could be.
That&#39;s the very man in that cab, I&#39;m positive.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And when you and Pauline went out to the Exhibition
you left him with your mistress, you say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, sir. They were in the drawing-room together;
and quarreling, too, for her voice was raised,
and she laughed twice in an angry way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quarreling&mdash;in French? You didn&#39;t catch&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, it was in French.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Inspector Winter leant his shoulder against the
house-wall, and his head slowly sank, and then all
at once dropped down with an air of utter abandonment,
for Furneaux was his friend&mdash;he had looked
on Furneaux as a brother.</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux, meantime, at Waterloo was taking
train to Tormouth, and his fixed stare boded no good
will to Rupert Osborne.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br/>
AT TORMOUTH</h2>

<p class="indent">Furneaux reached Tormouth about three in the
afternoon, and went boldly to the Swan Hotel, since
he was unknown by sight to Osborne. It was an
old-fashioned place, with a bar opening out of the
vestibule, and the first person that met his eye was
of interest to him&mdash;a man sitting in the bar-parlor,
who had &quot;Neapolitan&quot; written all over him&mdash;a face
that Furneaux had already marked in Soho. He
did not know the stranger&#39;s name, but he would have
wagered a large sum that this queer visitor to Tormouth
was a bird of the Janoc flock.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is he doing here?&quot; Furneaux asked himself;
and the only answer that suggested itself was:
&quot;Keeping an eye on Osborne. Perhaps that explains
how Janoc got hold of the name &#39;Glyn.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When he was left alone in the bedroom which he
took, he sat with his two hands between his knees,
his head bent low, giving ten minutes&#39; thought by
the clock to the subject of Anarchists. Presently
his lips muttered:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Clarke is investigating the murder on his own
account; he suspects that Anarchists were at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
bottom of it; he has let them see that he suspects;
and they have taken alarm, knowing that their ill
repute can&#39;t bear any added load of suspicion. Probably
she was more mixed up with them than is known;
probably there was some quarrel between them and
her; and so, seeing themselves suspected, they are
uneasy. Hence Janoc wrote to Osborne in Clarke&#39;s
name, asking how much Osborne knew of her connection
with Anarchists. He must have managed
somehow to have Osborne shadowed down here&mdash;must
be eager to have Osborne proved guilty. Hence,
perhaps, for some reason, the presence of that fellow
below there in the parlor. But I, for my
part, mustn&#39;t allow myself to be drawn off into
proving <i>them</i> guilty. Another, another, is my
prey!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He stood up sharply, crept to his door, and listened.
All the upper part of the house was as still
as the tomb at that hour. Mr. Glyn&mdash;Osborne&#39;s
name on the hotel register&mdash;was, Furneaux had been
told, out of doors.</p>

<p class="indent">He passed out into a corridor, and, though he
did not know which was Osborne&#39;s room, after peering
through two doorways discovered it at the third,
seeing in it a cane with a stag&#39;s head which Osborne
often carried. He slipped within, and in a moment
was everywhere at once in the room, filling it
with his presence, ransacking it with a hundred
eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">In one corner was an antiquated round table in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
mahogany, with a few books on it, and under the
books a copper-covered writing-pad. In the writing-pad
he found a letter&mdash;a long one, not yet finished,
in Osborne&#39;s hand, written to &quot;My dear Isadore.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The first words on which Furneaux&#39;s eyes fell were
&quot;her unstudied grace....&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="indent">... her walk has the undulating smoothness that one
looks for in some untamed creature of the wild.... You
are a painter, and a poet, and a student of the laws of Beauty.
Well, knowing all that, I still feel sure that you would be
conscious of a certain astonishment on seeing her move, she
moves so well. I confess I did not <i>know</i>, till I knew her, that
our human flesh could express such music. Her waist is small,
yet so willowy and sinuous that it cannot be trammeled in
those unyielding ribs of steel and bone in which women love
to girdle themselves. For her slimness she is tall, perhaps,
what you might think a little too tall until you stood by her
side and saw that her freedom of movement had deceived you.
Nor is she what you would call <i>a girl</i>: her age can&#39;t be a
day under twenty-three. But she does not make a motion of
the foot that her waist does not answer to it in as exact a
proportion as though the Angel of Grace was there with
measuring-tape and rod. If her left foot moves, her waist
sways by so much to the left; if her right, she sways to the
right, as surely as a lily on a long stalk swings to the will of
every wanton wind. But, after all, words cannot express the
poetry of her being. With her every step, I am confident
her toe in gliding forward touches the ground steadily, but
so zephyr-lightly, that only a megaphone could report it to the
ear. And not only is there a distinct forward bend of the
body in walking, but with every step her whole being and
soul walks&mdash;the mere physical movements are the least of it!
And her walk, I repeat, has the security, the lissome elegance
of a leopard&#39;s&mdash;her eyes, her mouth, her hair, her neck, those
of a Naiad balanced on the crest of a curling wave....</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
&quot;Ah-h-h!...&quot; murmured Furneaux on a long-drawn
breath, &quot;&#39;A Naiad&#39;! Something more fairy-like
than Rose de Bercy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He read on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Soon I shall see her dance&mdash;dance <i>with</i> her! and then you
shall hear. There&#39;s a certain Lord Spelding a little way from
here whom I know through a local doctor, and he is giving a
dance at his Abbey two evenings hence&mdash;she and her mother
are to be there. She has promised me that she will dance,
and I shall tell you how. But I expect nothing one whit
more consummate in the way of charm from her dancing than
from her ordinary motions. I know beforehand that her
dancing will be to her walking what the singing of a lovely
voice is to its talking&mdash;beauty moved to enthusiasm, but no
increase of beauty; the moon in a halo, but still the moon.
What, though, do you think of me in all this, my dear Isadore?
I have asked myself whether words like &quot;fickle,&quot; &quot;flighty,&quot;
&quot;forgetful,&quot; will not be in your mind as you read. And if
you are not tolerant, who will be? She, <i>the other</i>, is hardly
cold yet in her untimely tomb, and here am I ... shall I
say in love? say, at any rate, enraptured, down, down, on my
two bended knees. Certainly, the other was bitter to me&mdash;she
deceived, she pitilessly deceived; and I see now with the
clearest eyes that love was never the name of what I felt for
her, even if she had not deceived. But, oh, such a fountain
of pity is in me for her&mdash;untimely gone, cut off, the cup of
life in her hand, her lips purple with its wine&mdash;that I cannot
help reproaching this wandering of my eye from her. It is
rather shocking, rather horrible. And yet&mdash;I appeal to your
sympathy&mdash;I am no more master of myself in this than of
something that is now happening to the Emperor of China,
or that once happened to his grandfather.</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">The corners of Furneaux&#39;s lips turned downward,
and a lambent fire flamed in his eyes. He clutched
the paper in his hand as if he would strangle its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
dumb eloquence. Still he glowered at the letter,
and read.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="indent">But imagine, meanwhile, my false position here! I am
known to her and to her mother as Mr. Glyn; and <i>thrice</i> has
Osborne, the millionaire, the probable murderer of Rose de
Bercy, been discussed between us. Think of it!&mdash;the misery,
the falseness of it. If something were once to whisper to
Mrs. Marsh, &quot;this Mr. Glyn, to whom you are speaking in a
tone of chilly censure of such men as Osborne, is <i>Osborne
himself</i>; that translucent porcelain of your teacup has been
made impure by his lips; you should smash your Venetian
vases and Satsuma bowl of hollyhocks, since his not-too-immaculate
hands have touched them: beware! a snake has
stolen into your dainty and Puritan nest&quot;&mdash;if some imp of
unhappiness whispered that, what would she do? I can&#39;t
exactly imagine those still lips uttering a scream, but I can
see her lily fingers&mdash;like lilies just getting withered&mdash;lifted
an instant in mild horror of the sacrilege! As it is, her
admittance of me into the nest has been an unbending on her
part, an unbending touched with informality, for it was only
brought about through Richards, the doctor here, to whom I
got Smythe, one of my bankers, who is likewise Richards&#39;
banker, to speak of a &quot;Mr. Glyn.&quot; And if she now finds that
being gracious to the stranger smirches her, compromises her
in the slightest, she will put her thin dry lips together a little,
and say &quot;I am punished for my laxity in circumspection.&quot;
And then, ah! no more Rosalind for Osborne forever, if he
were ten times ten millionaires....</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Rosalind,&#39;&quot; murmured Furneaux, &quot;Rosalind
Marsh. That explains the scribble on the back of
the Janoc letter. He calls her Rosalind&mdash;breathes
her name to the moon&mdash;writes it! We shall see,
though.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At that moment he heard a step outside, and stood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
alert, ready to hide behind a curtain; but it was
only some hurrying housemaid who passed away.
He then put back the letter where he had found it;
and instantly tackled Osborne&#39;s portmanteaux. The
larger he found locked, the smaller, lying half under
the bed, was fastened with straps, but unlocked. He
quickly ransacked the knicknacks that it contained;
and was soon holding up to the light between thumb
and finger a singular object taken from the bottom
of the bag&mdash;a scrap of lace about six inches long,
half of it stained with a brown smear that was obviously
the smear of&mdash;blood.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a peculiar lace, Spanish hand-made, and
Furneaux knew well, none better than he, that the
dressing-gown in which Rose de Bercy had been murdered,
which she had thrown on preparatory to dressing
that night, was trimmed with Spanish hand-made
lace. He looked at this amazing bit of evidence
with a long interest there in the light from the window,
holding it away from him, frowning, thinking
his own thoughts behind his brow, as shadow chases
shadow. And presently he muttered the peculiar
words:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, any detective would swear that this was
a clew against him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He put it back into the bag, went out softly,
walked downstairs, and passed out into the little town.
A policeman told him where the house of Mrs. Marsh
was to be found, and he hastened half a mile out of
Tormouth to it.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
The house, &quot;St. Briavels,&quot; stood on a hillside behind
walls and wrought-iron gates and leafage,
through which peeped several gables rich in creepers
and ivy. Of Osborne, so far, there was no sign.</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux retraced his steps, came back to Tormouth,
sauntered beyond the town over the cliffs,
with the sea spread out in the sunlight, all sparkling
with far-flung sprightliness. And all at once he was
aware of a murmur of voices sounding out of Nowhere,
like the hum of bumble-bees on a slumbrous
afternoon. The ear could not catch if they were
right or left, above or below. But they became
louder; and suddenly there was a laugh, a delicious
low cadence of a woman&#39;s contralto that seemed to
roll up through an oboe in her throat. And now
he realized that the speakers were just below him
on the sands. He stepped nearer the edge of the
cliff, and, craning and peering stealthily through its
fringe of grasses, saw Osborne and a lady walking
westward over the sands.</p>

<p class="indent">Osborne was carrying an easel and a Japanese
umbrella. He was not looking where he was going,
not seeing the sea, or the sands, or the sun, but seeing
all things in the lady&#39;s face.</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux watched them till they were out of sight
behind a bend of the coast-line; he saw Osborne once
stumble a little over a stone, and right himself without
glancing at what he had stumbled on, without
taking his gaze from the woman by his side.</p>

<p class="indent">A bitter groan hissed from Furneaux&#39;s lips.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
&quot;But how about this fair Rosalind?&quot; he muttered
half aloud. &quot;Is this well for <i>her</i>? She should at
least be told who her suitor is&mdash;his name&mdash;his true
colors&mdash;the length and depth of his loves. There
is a way of stopping this....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He walked straight back to the hotel, and at once
took pen and paper to write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Dear Miss Prout</span>:&mdash;It has occurred to me that possibly you may
be putting yourself to the pains of discovering for me the
identity of the friend of Mr. Osborne, the &quot;Rosalind,&quot; as to
whom I asked you&mdash;in which case, to save you any trouble, I am
writing to tell you that I have now discovered who that lady is.
I am, you see, at present here in Tormouth, a very agreeable
little place.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yours truly,</span><br />
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">C. E. Furneaux</span>.</span><br />
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">And, as he directed the envelope, he said to himself
with a curious crowing of triumph that Winter
would have said was not to be expected from his
friend:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This should bring her here; and if it does&mdash;&mdash;!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Whereupon a singular glitter appeared an instant
in his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">Having posted the letter, he told the young woman
in the bar, who also acted as bookkeeper, that, after
all, he would not be able to stay the night. He
paid, nevertheless, for the room, and walked away
with his bag, no one knew whither, out of Tormouth.
Two hours later he returned to the hotel, and for
the second time that day took the same room, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
not a soul suspected for a moment that it was the
same Furneaux, since at present he had the look of
a meek old civil servant living on a mite of pension,
the color all washed out of his flabby cheeks and
hanging wrinkles.</p>

<p class="indent">His very suit-case now had a different physiognomy.
He bargained stingily for cheap terms, and
then ensconced himself in his apartment with a senile
chuckle, rubbing his palms together with satisfaction
at having obtained such good quarters so
cheaply.</p>

<p class="indent">The chambermaid, whom he had tipped well on
leaving, sniffed at this new visitor. &quot;Not much
to be got out of him,&quot; she said to her friend, the
boots.</p>

<p class="indent">The next afternoon at three o&#39;clock an elderly
lady arrived by the London train at Tormouth, and
she, too, came to put up at the Swan.</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux, at the moment of her arrival, was strolling
to and fro on the pavement in front of the
hotel, very shaky and old, a man with feeble knees,
threadbare coat, and shabby hat&mdash;so much so that
the manager had told the young person in the bar
to be sure and send in an account on Saturday.</p>

<p class="indent">Giving one near, clear, piercing glance into the
newcomer&#39;s face, round which trembled a colonnade
of iron-gray ringlets, Furneaux was satisfied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Marvelously well done!&quot; he thought. &quot;She has
been on the stage in her time, and to some purpose,
too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
The lady, without a glance at him, all a rustle of
brown silk, passed into the hotel.</p>

<p class="indent">The same night the old skinflint and the lady of
the iron-gray ringlets found themselves alone at a
table, eating of the same dishes. It was impossible
not to enter into conversation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your first visit to Tormouth, I think?&quot; began
Furneaux.</p>

<p class="indent">The lady inclined her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My name is Pugh, William Pugh,&quot; he told her.
&quot;I was in Tormouth some years ago, and know the
place rather well. Charming little spot! I shall
be most happy&mdash;if I may&mdash;if you will deign&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How long have you been here now?&quot; she asked
him in a rather mellow and subdued voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I only came yesterday,&quot; he answered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you by chance meet here a certain Mr. Furneaux?&quot;
she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let me see,&quot; said he&mdash;&quot;Furneaux. I&mdash;stay&mdash;I
believe I did! He was just departing at the time of
my arrival&mdash;little man&mdash;sharp, unpleasant face&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;hope
I do not speak of a friend or relative!&mdash;but
I believe I did hear someone say &#39;Mr. Furneaux.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At any rate, he is not here now?&quot; she demanded,
with an air of decision.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, he is gone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; she murmured, and something in the tone
of that &quot;Ah!&quot; made Furneaux&#39;s eye linger doubtfully
upon her an instant.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
Then the elderly lady wished to know who else
was in the hotel, if there was anyone of any interest,
and &quot;Mr. Pugh&quot; was apparently eager to gossip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is first of all a Mr. Glyn&mdash;a young man,
an American, I think, of whom I have heard a whisper
that he is enormously wealthy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is he in the room?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why is he&mdash;invisible?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am told that he has made friends in Tormouth
with a lady&mdash;a Mrs. Marsh&mdash;who resides at &#39;St.
Briavels&#39; some way out of town&mdash;not to mention
<i>Miss</i> Marsh&mdash;Rosalind is her name&mdash;upon whom I
hear he is more than a little sweet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He bent forward, shading his lips with his palm
to conceal the secret as it came out, and it was a
strange thing that the newly-arrived visitor could
not keep her ringlets from shaking with agitation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; she managed to say, &quot;when young people
meet&mdash;it is the old story. So he is probably at &#39;St.
Briavels&#39; now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Highly probable&mdash;if all I hear be true.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The ringleted dame put her knife and fork together,
rose, bowed with a gracious smile, and
walked away. Five minutes later Furneaux followed
her, went upstairs with soundless steps to his
room, and within it stood some time listening at
a crevice he had left between the door and the door-post.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he crept out, and spurting with swift suddenness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
silent as a cat, to Osborne&#39;s room, sent the
door open with a rush, and instantly was bowing
profoundly, saying: &quot;My dear madam! how <i>can</i> you
pardon me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For the lady was also in Osborne&#39;s room, as Furneaux
had known; and though there was no artificial
light, enough moonlight flooded the room to show
that even through her elaborate make-up a pallor
was suggested in her face, as she stood there suspended,
dumb.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Pugh seemed to be in a very pain of regret.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I had no idea that it was your room!&quot; he
pleaded. &quot;I&mdash;do forgive me&mdash;but I took it for
my own!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Oddly enough, the lady tittered, almost hysterically,
though she was evidently much relieved to find
who it was that had burst in so unceremoniously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The same accident has happened to me!&quot; she
cried. &quot;I took it to be my room, but it doesn&#39;t
seem&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, then, we both.... By the way,&quot; he added,
with a magnificent effort to escape an embarrassing
situation, &quot;what beautiful moonlight! And the
Tormouth country under it is like a fairy place. It
is a sin to be indoors. I am going for a stroll.
May I hope to have the pleasure&mdash;&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He wrung his palms wheedlingly together, and his
attitude showed that he was hanging on her answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I should like to take a walk&mdash;thank you,&quot;
she answered. Together they made for the door;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
he fluttered to his room, she to hers, to prepare.
Soon they were outside the hotel, walking slowly
under the moon. Apparently without definite directive,
they turned up the hill in the direction of
&quot;St. Briavels,&quot; nor was it many minutes before Mr.
Pugh began to prove himself somewhat of a gallant,
and gifted in the saying of those airy nothings which
are supposed to be agreeable to the feminine ear.
The lady, for her part, was not so thorny and hard
of heart as one might have thought from the staidness
of her air, and a good understanding was quickly
established between the oddly-assorted pair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rather an adventure, this, for people of our
age....&quot; she tittered, as they began to climb the
winding road.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, madam, we are not old!&quot; exclaimed the
lively Mr. Pugh, who might be seventy from his
decrepit semblance. &quot;Look at that moon&mdash;are not
our hearts still sensible to its seductive influences?
You, for your part, may possibly be nearing that
charming age of forty&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, sir! you flatter me....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Madam, no, on my word!&mdash;not a day over forty
would be given you by anyone! And if you have
the heart of twenty, as I am sure that you have,
what matters it if&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hush!&quot; she whispered, as a soft sound of the
piano from &quot;St. Briavels&quot; reached them.</p>

<p class="indent">Before them on the roadway they saw several carriages
drawn up near the great gates. The tinkle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
of the piano grew as they approached. Then they
saw a few lantern lights in the grounds glimmering
under the trees. Such signs spoke of a party in
progress. For once, the English climate was gracious
to its dupes.</p>

<p class="indent">The lady, without saying anything to her companion,
stepped into the shadow of a yew-tree opposite
the manor-close, and stood there, looking into
the grounds over the bars of a small gate, beyond
which a path ran through a shrubbery. On the
path were three couples, ladies with light scarves
draped over their décolleté dresses, men, bare-headed
and smoking cigarettes. They were very dim to
her vision, which must have been well preserved for
one of her age, despite Mr. Pugh&#39;s gallantry. The
overhanging foliage was dense, and only enough
moonlight oozed through the canopy of leaves to toss
moving patterns on the lawn and paths.</p>

<p class="indent">But the strange lady&#39;s eyes were now like gimlets,
with the very fire of youth burning in them, and it
was with the sure fleetness of youth that she suddenly
ran in a moment of opportunity from the yew to the
gate, pushed it a little open, and slipped aside into
a footpath that ran parallel with the lawn on which
the &quot;St. Briavels&quot; diners were now strolling.</p>

<p class="indent">With equal suddenness, or equal disregard of appearance,
Mr. Pugh, too, became young again, as
if both, like Philemon and Baucis, had all at once
quaffed the elixir of youth; and he was soon by the
young-old lady&#39;s side on the footpath. But her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
eyes, her ears, were so strained toward the lawn
before her, that she seemed not to be aware of his
presence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did not guess that you were interested in
the people here,&quot; he whispered. &quot;That man now
coming nearer is Mr. Glyn himself, and with him
is Miss Rosalind Marsh.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Sh-h-h</i>,&quot; came from her lips, a murmur long-drawn,
absent-minded, her eyes peering keenly forward.</p>

<p class="indent">He nudged her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it fitting that we should be here? We place
ourselves in a difficult position, if seen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sh-h-h-h-h....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Still he pestered her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Really it is a blunder.... We&mdash;we become&mdash;eavesdroppers&mdash;!
Let us&mdash;I suggest to
you&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, <i>do</i> keep quiet,&quot; she whispered irritably; and
in that instant the talk of Osborne and Rosalind
became audible to her. She heard him say:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I confess I have known Osborne, and I
believe the man perfectly incapable of the act attributed
to him by a hasty public opinion.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Intimately known him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rosalind turned her eyebrows upward in the moonlight.
Seen thus, she was amazingly beautiful.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do we intimately know anyone? Do we intimately
know ourselves?&quot; asked Osborne as he
passed within five yards of the two on the path. &quot;I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
think I may say that I know Osborne about as well
as I know anyone, and I am confident that he is
horribly misjudged. He is a young man of&mdash;yes,
I will say that for him&mdash;of good intentions; and he
is found guilty, without trial, of a wrong which he
never could have committed&mdash;and the wrong which
he <i>has</i> committed he is not found guilty of.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What wrong?&quot; asked Rosalind.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have heard&mdash;I know, in fact&mdash;that in the short
time that has passed since the murder of Miss de
Bercy, Osborne, her acknowledged lover, has allowed
himself to love another.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rosalind laughed, with the quiet amusement of
well-bred indifference.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What a weird person!&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">And as their words passed beyond hearing, a hiss,
like a snake&#39;s in the grass, rose from the shrubbery
behind them, a hiss of venom intensely low, and yet
loud enough to be heard by Furneaux, who, standing
a little behind the lady of the ringlets, rubbed his
hands together in silent and almost mischievous self-congratulation.</p>

<p class="indent">The house end of the lawn was not far, the words
of the returning pair were soon again within earshot.
The fiery glance of the watching woman,
ferreting, peering, dwelt on them&mdash;or rather on one
of them, for she gave no heed to Osborne at all.
Her very soul was centered on Rosalind, whose walk,
whose lips, whose eyes, whose hair, whose voice, she
ran over and estimated as an expert accountant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
reckons up a column of figures to ascertain their significance.
She missed no item in that calculation.
She noted the over-skirt of Chantilly, the wrap of
Venetian lace on the girl&#39;s head, the white slippers,
the roses disposed on her corsage with the harmless
vanity of the artist&#39;s skill, all these that fixed stare
ravenously devoured and digested while Rosalind took
half a dozen slow steps.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But seriously,&quot; she heard Osborne say, &quot;what is
your opinion of a love so apparently fickle and flighty
as this of Osborne&#39;s?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let me alone with your Osborne,&quot; Rosalind retorted
with another little laugh. &quot;A person of such
a mood is merely uninteresting, and below being a
topic. Let the dead lady&#39;s father or somebody
horsewhip him&mdash;I cannot care, I&#39;m afraid. Let us
talk about&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Ourselves?</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Ourselves and our king.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have so much to say about ourselves! Where
should I begin? And now that I have a few minutes,
I am throwing them away. Do you know, I never
seem to secure you free from interruption. Either
yourself or someone else intervenes every time, and
reduces me to silence and despair&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Their words passed beyond earshot again in the
other direction; and, as the lawn was wide between
house and screen of shrubbery on the road front,
it was some time before they were again heard. At
last, though, they came, and then Rosalind&#39;s low
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span>
tone of earnestness showed that this time, at least,
Osborne had been listened to.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will, since you ask, since you wish&quot;&mdash;her voice
faltered&mdash;&quot;to please you. You will be at the Abbey
to-morrow evening. And, since you say that you
so&mdash;desire it, I may then hear what you have to
say. Now I&#39;ll go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But when&mdash;where&mdash;&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If the night is fine, I will stroll into the gardens
during the evening. You will see me when I go.
On the south terrace of the Abbey there is a sun-dial
in the middle of a paved Italian garden. I&#39;ll
pass that way, and give you half an hour.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rosalind!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, no&mdash;not yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her lips sighed. She looked at him with a lingering
tenderness languishing in her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can I help it?&quot; he murmured, and his voice
quivered with passion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you glad now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Glad!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-by.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She left him hurriedly and sped with inimitable
grace of motion across the lawn toward the house,
and, while he looked after her, with the rapt vision
of a man who has communed with a spirit, the two
listeners crept to the little gate, slipped out when
a laughing couple turned their heads, and walked
back to the hotel.</p>

<p class="indent">The lady said never a word. Mr. Pugh was full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
of chat and merriment, but no syllable fell from
her tight-pressed lips.</p>

<p class="indent">The next day the lady was reported to have a
headache&mdash;at any rate she kept to her room, and
saw no one save the &quot;boots&quot; of the establishment,
with whom during the afternoon she had a lengthy
interview upstairs. At about seven in the evening
she was writing these words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Miss Marsh</span>:&mdash;Are you aware that the &quot;Mr. Glyn&quot; whom
you know here is no other than Mr. Rupert Osborne, who is
in everyone&#39;s mouth in connection with the Feldisham
Mansions Murder? You may take this as a positive fact
from</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;<span class="smcap">One Who Knows</span>.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">She wrote it in a handwriting that was very different
from her own, inclosed and directed it, and
then, about half-past seven, sent for &quot;boots&quot; again.</p>

<p class="indent">Her instructions were quite explicit:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wait in the paved rose garden at the Abbey,
the square sunken place with a sun-dial in the center,&quot;
she said. &quot;It is on the south terrace, and the
lady I have described will surely come. The moment
she appears hand the note to her, and be off&mdash;above
all else, answer no questions.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So the youth, with a sovereign in his pocket, hurried
away to do Hylda Prout&#39;s will&mdash;or was it Furneaux&#39;s?
Who might tell?</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br/>
AT THE SUN-DIAL</h2>

<p class="indent">The messenger of evil had waited twenty minutes
by the side of the sun-dial, when he saw a lady come
round the corner from the front of the house, and
saunter towards him. Moonlight lay weltering on
the white walks of the terrace, on the whiter slabs
of stone, on the water of the basin, on the surface
of the lake eastward where the lowest of the terraces
curved into the parkland that the wavelets lapped
on. It weltered, too, on the lady&#39;s hair, deftly coiled
and twisted into the coiffure of a Greek statue. It
shimmered on the powdered blue of her gown that
made her coming a little ghostly in that light, on
the rows of pearls around her throat, and on the
satin gloss of her shoes. She made straight for the
dial; and then, all at once, finding some unknown
man keeping the tryst, half halted.</p>

<p class="indent">He ran out to her, touched his cap, saying &quot;Miss
Marsh,&quot; handed her the note, touched his cap again,
and was going.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;From whom?&quot; she called after him in some
astonishment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lady at the Swan, miss&quot;&mdash;and he hurried off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
even more swiftly, for this was a question which he
had answered against orders.</p>

<p class="indent">She stood a little, looking at the envelope, her
breathing labored, an apprehension in her heart.
Then, hearing the coming of footsteps which she
knew, she broke it open, and ran her eye over the
few words.</p>

<p class="indent">Bending slightly, with the flood of the moon on
the paper, she could easily read the plainly written,
message.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="indent">... The Mr. Glyn whom you know is no other than the
Mr. Rupert Osborne who is in everyone&#39;s mouth in connection
with the Feldisham Mansions Murder....</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Now she laughed with a sudden catch of the breath,
gasping &quot;Oh!&quot; with a sharp impatience of all
anonymous scandalizers. But as her head rather
swam and span, she walked on quickly to the basin,
and there found it necessary to sit down on the
marble. The stab of pain passed in a few seconds,
and again she sprang up and laughed as lightly as
one of the little fountains in the basin that tossed
its tinted drops to the moonbeams.</p>

<p class="indent">Not twenty yards away was Osborne coming to
her.</p>

<p class="indent">She looked at him steadily&mdash;her marvelous eyes
self-searching for sure remembrance of the earnestness
with which he had pleaded in favor of the lover
of Rose de Bercy&mdash;how he had said that Osborne
had already loved again; and how she, Rosalind&mdash;oh,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
how blind and deaf!&mdash;heedlessly had brushed
aside his words, saying that a man of that mood was
below being a topic....</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it half an hour?&quot; Osborne came whispering,
with a bending of the body that was like an act of
worship.</p>

<p class="indent">She smiled. In the moonlight he could not perceive
how ethereally white was her face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is one half-minute!... It was rather quixotic
of you to have proposed, and of me to have
accepted, such a meeting. But I felt sure that by
this hour others would be strolling about the terraces.
As it is, you see, we are pioneers without followers.
So, till we meet again&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She seemed to be about to hurry away without another
word; he stood aghast.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, Rosalind&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What? How dare you call me Rosalind?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Now her eyes flashed upon him like sudden lightning
from a dark blue sky, and the scorn in her
voice blighted him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I&mdash;don&#39;t understand,&quot; he stammered, trying
to come nearer. She drew her skirts aside with a
disdain that was terrifying.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she laughed softly again; and was gone.</p>

<p class="indent">He looked after her as after treasure that one sees
sinking into the sea, flashing in its descent to the
depths. For one mad instant he had an impulse
to run in vain pursuit, but instead he gave way, sank
down upon the edge of the marble basin, just where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
she had dropped a few brief seconds earlier, covered
his face, and a groan that was half a sob broke so
loudly from his throat that she heard it. She hesitated,
nearly stopped, did not look round, scourged
herself into resolution, and in another moment had
turned the corner of the house and was lost to
sight.</p>

<p class="indent">What had happened to change his Rosalind into
this unapproachable empress Osborne was too
stunned to ask himself explicitly. He knew he was
banned, and that was enough. Deep in his subconsciousness
he understood that somehow she had
found out his wretched secret&mdash;found out that he
was not the happy Glyn reeling through an insecure
dream in fairyland, but the unhappy Osborne, heavily
tangled in the sordid and the commonplace.</p>

<p class="indent">And, because he was unhappy and troubled, she
left him without pity, turned her back eternally upon
him. That hurt. As he stood up to walk away
toward Tormouth, a fierce anger and a gush of
self-pity battled in his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">He had no more hope. He wandered on through
the night, unseeing, stricken as never before. At
last he reached the hotel, and, as soon as he could
summon the energy, began to pack his portmanteau
to go back to London. The day of the postponed
inquest now loomed near, and he cared not a jot
what became of him, only asking dumbly to be taken
far from Tormouth.</p>

<p class="indent">As he was packing the smaller of the bags, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>
saw the scrap of blood-stained lace that Furneaux
had already seen, had taken out, and had replaced.
Osborne, with that same feeling of repulsion with
which Furneaux had thrust it away from him, held
it up to the light. What was it? How could it
have got into his bag? he asked himself&mdash;a bit of
lace stained with blood! His amazement knew no
bounds&mdash;and would have been still more profound,
if possible, had he seen Furneaux&#39;s singular act in
replacing it in the bag after finding it.</p>

<p class="indent">He threw the horrible thing from him out of the
window, and his very fingers tingled with disgust of
it. But then came the disturbing thought&mdash;suppose
it had been put into his bag as a trap? by
the police, perhaps? And suppose any apparent
eagerness of his to rid himself of it should be regarded
as compromising? He was beginning to
be circumspect now, timorous, ostentatious of that
innocence in which a whole world disbelieved.</p>

<p class="indent">So he glanced out of the window, saw where the
lace had dropped upon a sloping spread of turf
in the hotel grounds, and ran down to get it. When
he arrived at the spot where he had just seen it, the
lace had disappeared.</p>

<p class="indent">He stood utterly mystified, looking down at the
spot where the lace should be and was not; then
looked around in a maze, to discover on a rustic seat
that surrounded an oak tree an elderly lady and a
bent old man sitting there in the shadow. Some
distance off, lounging among the flower beds in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg&nbsp;131]</span>
moonlight, was the figure of a tall man. Osborne
was about to inquire of the two nearest him if they
had seen the lace, when the old gentleman hurried
nimbly forward out of the tree&#39;s shadow and asked
if he was seeking a piece of something that had
dropped from above.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Osborne, &quot;have you seen it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That gentleman walking yonder was just under
your window when it dropped, and I saw him stoop
to pick it up,&quot; said the other.</p>

<p class="indent">Osborne thanked him, and made for &quot;the gentleman,&quot;
who turned out to be a jauntily-dressed
Italian, bony-faced, square in the jaw, his hair
clipped convict-short, but dandily brushed up at the
corner of the forehead.</p>

<p class="indent">To the question: &quot;Did you by chance pick up
a bit of lace just now?&quot; he at once bowed, and
showing his teeth in a grin, said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He dropped right to my feet from the sky; here
he is&quot;&mdash;and he presented the lace with much ceremony.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am obliged,&quot; said Osborne.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do not say it,&quot; answered the other politely, and
they parted, Osborne hurrying back to his room,
with the intent to catch a midnight train from Tormouth.</p>

<p class="indent">As he entered the house again, the older man, incredibly
quick on his uncertain feet, overtook him,
and, touching him on the arm, asked if he intended
to catch the train that night.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
&quot;That is my desire,&quot; answered Osborne.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is mine, too,&quot; said the other; &quot;now, could you
give me a seat in your conveyance?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Osborne said, &quot;With pleasure,&quot; and they entered
the hotel to prepare to go.</p>

<p class="indent">At the same moment the Italian sauntered up to
the oak tree beneath which sat Hylda Prout in her
Tormouth make-up. Seating himself without seeking
her permission, he lit a cigarette.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-evening,&quot; he said, after enveloping himself
in a cloud of smoke. She did not answer, but
evidently he was not one to be rebuffed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your friend, Mistare Pooh, he is sharp! My!
he see all,&quot; he said affably.</p>

<p class="indent">This drew a reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are quite right,&quot; she said. &quot;He sees all,
or nearly all. Do you mean because he saw you
pick up the lace?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now&mdash;how <i>you</i> know it was <i>lace</i>?&quot; asked the
Italian, turning full upon her. &quot;You sitting here,
you couldn&#39;t see it was lace so far&mdash;no eyes could see
that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This frankness confused the lady a moment; then
she laughed a little, for he had supplied her with
a retort.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps I see all, too, like my friend.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a silence, but the Italian was apparently
waiting only to rehearse his English.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know Mr. Glyn&mdash;yes?&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span>
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t say &#39;no&#39;!&quot; Reproach was in his ogle,
his voice. His tone was almost wheedling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The way I find you spying after him this morning
tell me that you know him. And I know that
you know him before that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What concern is it of <i>yours</i>?&quot; she asked, looking
at him with a lowering of the lids in a quick
scrutiny that was almost startled. &quot;What is <i>your</i>
interest in Mr. Glyn?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say &#39;Osborne&#39; and be done,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, say &#39;Osborne,&#39;&quot; she responded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good. We are going to understand the one the
other, I can see. But if you want to know what is
&#39;my interest&#39; in the man, you on your part will
tell me first if you are friend or enemy of Osborne.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In one second she had reflected, and said:
&quot;Enemy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His hand shot out in silence to her, and she shook
it. The mere action drew them closer on the seat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I believe you,&quot; he whispered, &quot;and I knew it,
too, for if you had been a friend you would not be
in a disguise from him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you know that I am in a disguise?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Since yesterday morning I know,&quot; he answered,
&quot;when I see you raise your blind yonder, not an
old woman, but a young and charming lady not yet
fully dressed, for I was here in the garden, looking
out for what I could see, and my poor heart was
pierced by the vision at the window.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span>
He pressed his palm dramatically on his breast.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, of course, it is on the left, as usual,&quot; said
Hylda Prout saucily. &quot;But let us confine ourselves
to business for the moment. I don&#39;t quite understand
your object. As to the bit of lace&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How you <i>know</i> it was lace?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She looked cautiously all round before answering.
&quot;I know because I searched Mr. Osborne&#39;s room,
and saw it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good! Before long we understand the one the
other. You be frank, I be frank. You spied into
the bag, and <i>I</i> put it in the bag.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know you did.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, how you know?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There was no one else to do it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No? Might not Osborne put it there himself?
You know where that bit of lace come
from?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What you guess?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess that it is from the dress of the dead
actress, for it has blood on it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You guess good&mdash;very good. And Osborne
killed her&mdash;yes?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She pondered a little. This attack had come on
her from a moonlit sky.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That I don&#39;t know. He may have, and he may
not,&quot; she murmured.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Which is more likely? That <i>he</i> killed her, or
that <i>I</i> killed her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
&quot;I don&#39;t know. I should say it is more likely
that you killed her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What! You pay me that compliment? Why
so?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you are in possession of a portion of the
dress she wore when she was killed, and you put it
into someone&#39;s belongings to make it seem that he
killed her, an act which looks a little black against
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, ma bella, now you jest,&quot; said the Italian,
laughing. &quot;The fact that I am so frank with you
as to say you all this is proof that I not kill her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I see that,&quot; she agreed. &quot;I was only joking.
But since you did not kill her, how on earth
did you get hold of that piece of her dress?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That you are going to know when I have received
better proof that you are as much as I the enemy
of Osborne. Did I not guess good, on seeing you
yesterday morning at the window, that you are the
same young lady who is Osborne&#39;s secretary in London,
where I see you before?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hylda Prout admitted that she was the secretary.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good, then,&quot; said the Italian; &quot;you staying in
the house with him have every opportunity to find
proof of his guilt of the murder; until which is
proved, the necks of those I am working for are in
danger.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With the impulsive gesture of his race he drew
his forefinger in ghastly mimicry across his throat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So bad as that?&quot; asked the woman coolly. &quot;Unfortunately,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span>
I don&#39;t know who &#39;those&#39; are you are
working for. The&mdash;&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Anarchists?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you call them so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did <i>they</i> kill her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not they!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did they intend to?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not they!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then, where did you get that bit of lace? And
where is the dagger?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dagger! What about dagger now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He asked it with a guilty start. At last the talk
was taking a turn which left Hylda Prout in command.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you have that lace, you have the dagger, too.
And if you have the dagger, what help do you want
from me? Produce that, and Osborne is done for.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her voice sank to a whisper. If Furneaux could
have been present he must have felt proud of her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dagger!&quot; muttered the Italian again in a
hushed tone. &quot;You seem to know much more&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stay, let us get up and walk. It is not quite
safe here.... There are too many trees.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The man, who had lost his air of self-confidence,
seemed to be unable to decide what to do for the
best. But Hylda Prout had risen, and he, too,
stood up. He was compelled to follow her. Together
they passed through the grounds toward the
cliffs.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span>
The same moonlight that saw them strolling there,
saw at the same time Furneaux and Osborne racing
in a trap along the road to Sedgecombe Junction
to catch the late train on the main line. Furneaux
was inclined to be chatty, but Osborne answered only
in monosyllables, till his companion&#39;s talk turned
upon the murder of the actress, when Osborne, with
a sudden access of fury, assured him in very emphatic
language that his ears were weary of that
dreadful business, and prayed to be spared it. The
old gentleman seemed to be shocked, but Osborne
only glanced at his watch, muttering that they would
have to be smart to catch the train; and as he put
back the watch in its pocket, the other dropped his
bag over the side of the vehicle.</p>

<p class="indent">There was nothing to be done but to stop, and
the delinquent, with the stiffness and slowness of age,
descended to pick it up. Thus some precious minutes
were wasted. Furneaux, in fact, did not wish Osborne
to start for London that night at that late
hour, since he wanted to apprise Winter of Osborne&#39;s
departure. Hence he had begged a seat in the conveyance,
and had already lost time at the hotel. A
little later, when Osborne again glanced at his watch,
it was to say: &quot;Oh, well, there is no use in going
on,&quot; and he called to the driver to turn back. Indeed,
the whistle of the departing train was heard at
the station half a mile away.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, yes,&quot; said Furneaux, curiously pertinacious,
when the dog-cart was on the homeward road,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span>
&quot;one is weary of hearing this murder discussed.
I only spoke of it to express to you my feeling of
disapproval of the lover&mdash;of the man Osborne. Is
it credible to you that he was not even at her funeral?
No doubt he was advised not to be&mdash;no doubt it
was wise from a certain point of view. But <i>nothing</i>
should have prevented him, if he had had any affection
for her. But he had none&mdash;he was a liar. Talk
of her deceiving him! It was he&mdash;it was <i>he</i>&mdash;who
deceived her, I say!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have a cigar,&quot; said Osborne, presenting his case;
&quot;these are rather good ones; you will find them
soothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His hospitality was declined, but there was no
more talk, and the trap trotted back into Tormouth.</p>

<p class="indent">Up at &quot;St. Briavels&quot; that same moment the same
moonlight, shining on a balcony, illumined yet another
scene in the network of events. Rosalind
Marsh was sitting there alone, her head bent between
her clenched hands. She had returned home early
from the Abbey, and Mrs. Marsh, who had silently
wondered, presently came out with the softness of a
shadow upon her, and touched her shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is the matter?&quot; she asked in a murmur of
sympathy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My head aches a little, mother dear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am sorry. You look tired.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, yes, dear. There are moments of infinite
weariness in life. One cannot avoid them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you dance?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span>
&quot;Only a little.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Weary of emotions, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The old lady smiled faintly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mother!&quot; whispered Rosalind, and pressed her
mother&#39;s hand to her forehead.</p>

<p class="indent">There was silence for a while. When Mrs. Marsh
spoke again it was to change the subject.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have been too long at Tormouth this time.
I think you need a change. Suppose we took a
little of London now? Society might brighten you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes! Let us go from this place!&quot; said
Rosalind under her breath, her fingers tightly
clenched together.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, then, the sooner the better,&quot; said Mrs.
Marsh. &quot;Let it be to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rosalind looked up with gratitude and the moonlight
in her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you, dear one,&quot; she said. &quot;You are
always skilled in divining, and never fail in being
right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And so it was done. The next forenoon saw the
mother and daughter driving in an open landau
past the Swan to Tormouth station, and, as they
rolled by in state, Hylda Prout, who was peeping
from a window after the figure of Osborne on <i>his</i>
way to the station, saw them.</p>

<p class="indent">A glitter came into her eyes, and the unspoken
thought was voiced in eloquent gesture: &quot;What, following
him so soon?&quot;&mdash;for she knew that they could
only be going by the London train, which had but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
one stopping-place after Tormouth. At once she
rushed in a frenzy of haste to prepare to travel by
that very train.</p>

<p class="indent">Some wild ringing of bells and promise of reward
brought chambermaid and &quot;boots&quot; to her aid.</p>

<p class="indent">In her descent to the office to pay her bill she
was encountered by her new friend, the Italian, who,
surprised at her haste, said to her, &quot;What, you go?&quot;&mdash;to
which she, hardly stopping, answered: &quot;Yes&mdash;we
will meet when we said&mdash;in two days&#39; time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But me, too, I go,&quot; he cried, and ran to get
ready, the antics of the pair creating some stir of
interest in the bar parlor.</p>

<p class="indent">At this time Furneaux was already at the station,
awaiting the train, having already wired to Winter
in London to meet him at Waterloo. And so the
same train carried all their various thoughts and
purposes and secrets in its different compartments
on the Londonward journey.</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux, who chose to sit in the compartment
with Rosalind and Mrs. Marsh, listened to every
sigh and syllable of Rosalind, and, with the privilege
of the aged, addressed some remarks to his fellow-travelers.
Hylda Prout and the Italian were together&mdash;a
singular bond of intimacy having suddenly
forged itself between these two. They were
alone, and Hylda, who left Tormouth old and iron-gray,
arrived at London red-headed and young,
freckle-splashed and pretty. But as for Osborne,
he traveled in the dull company of his black thoughts.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>
The first to alight at Waterloo, before the train
stopped, was Furneaux. His searching eyes at once
discovered Winter waiting on the platform. In a
moment the Chief Inspector had a wizened old man
at his ear, saying: &quot;Winter&mdash;I&#39;m here. Came with
the crowd.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hallo,&quot; said Winter, and from old-time habit
of friendship his hand half went out. Furneaux,
however, seemed not to notice the action, and Winter&#39;s
hand drew back.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Osborne is in the train,&quot; whispered Furneaux.
&quot;I telegraphed because there is an object in his
smaller bag that I want you to see&mdash;as a witness,
instantly. There he comes; ask him into the first-class
waiting-room. It is usually empty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux himself went straight into the waiting-room
and sat in a corner behind a newspaper. Soon
in came Winter, talking to Osborne with a marked
deference:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will forgive me, I am sure, for this apparent
lack of confidence, but in an affair of this sort one
leaves no stone unturned.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do not mention it,&quot; said Osborne, who was rather
pale. &quot;I think I can guess what it is that you
wish to see....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A porter, who had followed them, put the two
portmanteaux on a table, and went out. Osborne
opened the smaller one, and Winter promptly had
the blood-stained bit of lace in his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it, sir?&quot; asked Winter.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span>
&quot;Heaven knows,&quot; came the weary answer. &quot;It
was not in my possession when I left London, and
was put into one of my bags by someone at Tormouth.
When I found it, I threw it out of the
window, as that gentleman there can prove,&quot; for he
had seen Furneaux, but was too jaded to give the
least thought to his unaccountable presence. &quot;Afterwards
I ran down and recovered it. <i>He</i> was in the
garden....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The unhappy young man&#39;s glance wandered out
of the door to see Rosalind and her mother go past
towards a waiting cab. He cared not a jot if all
Scotland Yard were dogging his footsteps now.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that so, sir?&quot; asked Winter of Furneaux.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Exactly as Mr. Glyn says,&quot; answered Furneaux,
looking at them furtively, and darting one very
curious glance at Winter&#39;s face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And who, Mr.&mdash;Glyn, was about the place whom
you could possibly suspect of having placed this
object in your bag&mdash;someone with a wicked motive
for throwing suspicion upon you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter&#39;s lips whitened and dwelt with venom upon
the word &quot;wicked.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There was absolutely no one,&quot; answered Osborne.
&quot;The hotel was rather empty. Of course, there
was this gentleman&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Winter after him, &quot;this gentleman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An elderly lady, a Mrs. Forbes, I believe, as
I happened to read her name, a foreigner who probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span>
never saw me before, an invalid girl and her
sister&mdash;all absolutely unconnected with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux&#39;s eyes were now glued on Winter&#39;s
face. They seemed to have a queer meaning in
them, a meaning not wholly devoid of spite and
malice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Mr.&mdash;Glyn,&quot; said Winter, &quot;let me tell
you, if you do not know, that this bit of lace was
certainly part of the dress in which Miss de Bercy
was murdered. Therefore the man&mdash;or woman&mdash;who
put it into your bag was there&mdash;on the spot&mdash;when
the deed was done.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Osborne did then exhibit some perplexed interest
in a strange discovery.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How can you be certain that it was part of her
dress?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because a fragment of lace of this size was torn
from the wrap she was wearing at the time of the
murder&mdash;I noticed it at my first sight of the body.
This piece would just fit into it. So, whoever put
it into your bag&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In that case I may have put it in myself!&quot; said
Osborne with a nervous laugh, &quot;since I may be the
murderer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Apparently the careless comment annoyed Winter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think I need detain you any longer, sir,&quot;
he said coldly. &quot;As for the lace, I&#39;ll keep it. I
feel very confident that this part of the mystery will
not baffle me for more than a day or two.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And ever the eyes of Furneaux dwelt upon Winter&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
face with that queer meaning reveling in their
underlook.</p>

<p class="indent">Osborne turned to go. He did not trouble to call
another porter, but carried his own luggage. He
was about to enter a cab when he caught sight of
the back of a woman&#39;s head among the crowd hurrying
to an exit, a head which seemed singularly
familiar to him. The next moment it was gone
from his sight, which was a pity, since the head belonged
to Hylda Prout, who had not anticipated
that Osborne would be delayed on the platform, and
had had to steal past the waiting-room door at a
rush, since she was no longer an old lady, but herself.
She could not wait in the train till he was
well away, for she thought it well to ascertain the
whereabouts of Rosalind Marsh in London, and
wished to shadow her.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Marsh and her daughter carried the usual
mountain of ladies&#39; luggage, which demanded time
and care in stowing safely on the roof of a four-wheeler,
so Hylda Prout was in time to call a hansom
and follow them. After her went the Italian, who
made off hastily when the train arrived, but lurked
about until he could follow the girl unseen, for she
had frightened him.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, at the station that day, keeping well in
the background, was a third detective beside Winter
and Furneaux.</p>

<p class="indent">Clarke, with his interest in Anarchists, knew that
this particular Italian was coming from Tormouth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
either that day or the day after. Two nights before,
while on a visit to the Fraternal Club in Soho, he had
overheard the whispered word that &quot;Antonio&quot; would
&quot;be back&quot; on the Wednesday or the Thursday.</p>

<p class="indent">Clarke did not know Antonio&#39;s particular retreat
in London, and had strong reasons for wishing to
know it. He, therefore, followed in a cab the cab
that followed Rosalind&#39;s cab. In any other city
in the world than London such a procession would
excite comment&mdash;if it passed through street after
street, that is. But not so in cab-using London,
where a string of a hundred taxis, hansoms, and
four-wheelers may all be going in the same direction
simultaneously.</p>

<p class="indent">As Clarke went westward down the Strand and
across Trafalgar Square, he was full of meditations.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is Antonio doing with Osborne&#39;s lady secretary?&quot;
he asked himself. &quot;For that is the young
woman he is after, I&#39;ll swear. By Jove, there&#39;s
more in this tangle than meets the eye. It&#39;s a case
for keeping both eyes, and a third, if I had it, wide,
wide open!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rosalind&#39;s and Mrs. Marsh&#39;s cab drew up before
a house in Porchester Gardens. As they got out
and went up the steps, the cabs containing Antonio
and Hylda Prout almost stopped, but each went on
again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, what in the world is the matter?&quot; mused
Clarke. &quot;Why are those two shadowing a couple
of ladies, and sneaking on each other as well?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
He told his own driver to pass the house slowly,
as he wished to note its number, and the vehicle was
exactly opposite the front door when it was opened
by a girl with a cap on her head to let in Mrs. Marsh
and Rosalind; Clarke&#39;s eye rested on her, and lit
with a strange fire. A cry of discovery leapt to
his lips, but was not uttered. A moment after the
door had closed upon the two travelers, Clarke&#39;s hand
was at the trap-door in the roof of the hansom, and,
careless whether or not he was seen, he leaped out,
ran up the steps, and rang.</p>

<p class="indent">A moment more and the door was opened to him
by the same girl, whom he had recognized instantly
as Pauline Dessaulx, the late lady&#39;s-maid of Rose
de Bercy&mdash;a girl for whom he had ransacked London
in vain. And not he alone, for Pauline had very
effectively buried herself from the afternoon after
the murder, when Clarke had seen her once, and she
him, to this moment. And there now they stood,
Clarke and Pauline, face to face.</p>

<p class="indent">He, for his part, never saw such a change in a
human countenance as now took place in this girl&#39;s.
Her pretty brown cheeks at once, as her eyes fell
on him, assumed the whiteness of death itself. Her
lips, the very rims of her eyelids even, looked ghastly.
She seemed to be on the verge of collapse, and her
whole frame trembled in an agony of fear. Why?
What caused these deadly tremors? Instantly
Clarke saw guilt in this excess of emotion, and by
one of those inspirations vouchsafed sometimes even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
to men of his coarse fiber he did the cleverest act of
his life.</p>

<p class="indent">Putting out his hand, he said quietly, but roughly:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come now, no nonsense! Give it to me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">What &quot;it&quot; meant he himself had no more notion
than the man in the moon. His real motive was to
set the terrified girl speaking, and thus lead her on
to yield some chance clew on which his wits might
work. But at once, like one hypnotized, Pauline
Dessaulx, still keeping her eyes fixed on his face,
slowly moved her right hand to a pocket, slowly drew
out a little book, and slowly handed it to him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right&mdash;you are wise,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;ll see
you again.&quot; The door slammed, and he ran down
the steps, his blood tingling with the sense that he
had blundered upon some tremendous discovery.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor was he far wrong. When in the cab he
opened the book, he saw it was Rose de Bercy&#39;s diary.
He did not know her handwriting, but he happened
to open the book at the last written page, and the
very first words his staring eyes devoured were these:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="indent">If I am killed this night, it will be by &mdash;&mdash; or by C. E. F.</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Where the blank occurred it was evident that some
name had been written, and heavily scratched through
with pen and ink.</p>

<p class="indent">But the alternative suggested by the initials!
C. E. F.! How grotesque, how exquisitely ludicrous!
Clarke, gazing at the enigma, was suddenly shaken
with a spasm of hysterical laughter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br/>
THE LETTER</h2>

<p class="indent">Two days later, not Britain alone, but no small
part of the two hemispheres, was stirred to the depths
by the adjourned inquest on the Feldisham Mansions
crime. Nevertheless, though there were sensations
in plenty, the public felt vaguely a sense of incompleteness
in the process, and of dissatisfaction with
the result. The police seemed to be both unready
and unconvinced; no one was quite sincere in anything
that was said; the authorities were swayed by
some afterthought; in popular phrase, they appeared
&quot;to have something up their sleeve.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux, this time, figured for the police; but
Winter, too, was there unobtrusively; and, behind,
hidden away as a mere spectator, was Clarke, smiling
the smile that knows more than all the world, his
hard mouth set in fixed lines like carved wood.</p>

<p class="indent">As against Osborne the inquiry went hard. More
and more the hearts of the witnesses and jury grew
hot against him, and, by a kind of electric sympathy,
the blood of the crowd which gathered outside the
court caught the fever and became inflamed with its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>
own rage, lashing itself to a fury with coarse jibes
and bitter revilings.</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux, bringing forth and marshaling evidence
on evidence against Osborne, let his eye light often
on Winter; then he would look away hastily as
though he feared his face might betray his thoughts.</p>

<p class="indent">In that small head of his were working more, by
far more, secret things, dark intents, unspoken mazy
purposes, than in all the heads put together in the
busy court. He was pale, too, but his pallor was
nothing compared with the marble forehead of Winter,
whose eyes were nailed to the ground, and whose
forehead was knit in a frown grim and hard as rock.</p>

<p class="indent">It was rarely that he so much as glanced up from
the reverie of pitch-black doubts weltering through
his brain like some maelstrom drowned in midnight.
Once he glanced keenly upon William Campbell, the
taxicab driver, who kept twirling his motor-cap round
and round on his finger until an irritated coroner
protested; once again did he glance at Mrs. Bates,
housekeeper, and at the fountain of tears that flowed
from her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">Campbell was asked to pick out the man whom
he had driven from Berkeley Street to Feldisham
Mansions, if he saw him in court. He pointed
straight at Osborne.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will swear that that is the man?&quot; he was
asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, not swear,&quot; he said, and looked round defiantly,
as if he knew that most of those present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
were almost disappointed with his non-committal answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just think&mdash;look at him well,&quot; said the Treasury
representative, as Osborne stood up to confront the
driver with his pale face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That gentleman is like him&mdash;very like him&mdash;that&#39;s
all I&#39;ll swear to. His manner of dress, his
stand, his height, yes, and his face, his mustache, the
chin, the few hairs there between the eyebrows&mdash;remarkably
like, sir&mdash;for I recollect the man well
enough. It may have been his double, but I&#39;m not
here to swear positively it was Mr. Osborne, because
I&#39;m not sure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We will take it, then, that, assuming there were
two men, the one was so much like the other that
you swear it was either Mr. Osborne or his double?&quot;
the coroner said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I&#39;ll go so far as that, sir,&quot; agreed Campbell,
and, at this admission, Furneaux glanced at a
veiled figure that sat among the witnesses at the back
of the court.</p>

<p class="indent">He knew that Rosalind Marsh was present, and
his expression softened a little. Then he looked at
another veiled woman&mdash;Hylda Prout&mdash;and saw that
her eyes were fastened, not on the witness, but ever
on Rosalind Marsh, as though there was no object,
no interest, in the room but that one black-clothed
figure of Rosalind.</p>

<p class="indent">Campbell&#39;s memory of the drive was ransacked,
and turned inside out, and thrashed and tormented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span>
by one and another to weariness; and then it was
the turn of Hester Bates, all tears, to tell how she
had seen someone like unto Osborne on the stairs at
five to eight, whose feet seemed to reel like a drunken
man&#39;s, and who afterwards impressed her, when she
thought of it, as a shape rather of limbo and spirit-land
than of Mayfair and everyday life.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the flint ax-head, or celt, was presented to
the court, and Hylda Prout was called to give evidence
against her employer. She told how she had
missed an ax-head from the museum, and also a Saracen
dagger, but whether this was the very ax-head
that was missing she could not say. It was very
like it&mdash;that was all&mdash;and even Osborne showed his
amaze at her collectedness, her calm indifference to
many eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;May I not be allowed to examine it?&quot; he asked
his solicitor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not?&quot; said the coroner, and there was a
tense moment when the celt was handed him.</p>

<p class="indent">He bent over it two seconds, and then said quietly:
&quot;This is certainly one of my collection of flints!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His solicitor, taken quite aback, muttered an angry
protest, and a queer murmur made itself felt.
Osborne heard both the lawyer&#39;s words and the subdued
&quot;Ah!&quot; of the others echoing in his aching
heart. By this time he was as inwardly sensitive
to the opinion of the mob as a wretch in the hands
of inquisitors to the whim and humors of his torturers.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
&quot;That evidence will be taken on oath in due
course,&quot; said the coroner, dryly official, and the examination
of Miss Prout went on after the incident.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And now as to the dagger,&quot; resumed the Treasury
solicitor, &quot;tell us of that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She described it, its shape, the blunt edges of the
long and pointed blade, the handle, the label on it
with the date. It was Saracen, and it, too, like the
celt, had once been used, in all probability, in the
hands of wild men in shedding blood.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you are sure of the date when you first
missed it from its place in the museum?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was on the third day after the murder&quot;&mdash;and
Hylda Prout&#39;s glance traveled for an instant
to the veiled, bent head of Rosalind, as it seemed to
droop lower after every answer that she gave.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you are unable to conceive how both the
dagger and the celt could have vanished from their
places about that time?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I conceive that they were stolen,&quot; she said&mdash;&quot;unless
Mr. Osborne made them a present to some
friend, for I have known him to do that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Stolen,&#39; you say,&quot; the Treasury man remarked.
&quot;But you have no grounds for such a belief? You
suggest no motive for a thief to steal these two objects
and no other from the museum? You know
of no one who entered the room during those days?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I know of no one&mdash;except Inspector Furneaux,
who seems to have entered it about six o&#39;clock
on the evening of the murder.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span>
The coroner looked up sharply from his notes.
This was news to the court.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh?&quot; said the examiner. &quot;Let us hear how
that came about.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She explained that Furneaux had called to see Mr.
Osborne, and, while awaiting his coming in the library,
had apparently strolled into the museum.
Jenkins, Mr. Osborne&#39;s valet, was her informant. It
was not evidence, but the statement was out before
the court well knew where it was leading. Winter&#39;s
lip quivered with suppressed agitation, and over
Clarke&#39;s face came a strange expression of amazement,
a stare of utter wonderment widening his eyes,
as when one has been violently struck, and knows
not by what or whom.</p>

<p class="indent">When Hylda Prout stepped down, the coroner
invited the officer in charge of the case to explain the
curious bit of intelligence given by the last witness.</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux, not one whit disturbed in manner, rose
to give his evidence of the incident. Oddly enough,
his eyes dwelt all the time, with a dull deadness of
expression in them, upon the lowered face of Winter.</p>

<p class="indent">It was true, he told the court, that he had called
upon Mr. Osborne that evening; it was true that he
was asked to wait; and he seemed to remember now
that he <i>had</i> wandered through a doorway into a room
full of curios to have a look at them in those idle
moments.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So you knew Mr. Osborne <i>before</i> the murder?&quot;
inquired the court.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span>
&quot;Yes. I knew him very well by sight and repute,
as a man about town, though not to speak to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what was the nature of the business on
which you called to see him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was a purely personal matter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The coroner paused, with the air of a man who
suddenly discovers a morass where he imagined there
was a clear road.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And did you see Mr. Osborne that evening?&quot;
he asked at length.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, sir. After I had waited some time the valet
entered and told me that Mr. Osborne had just telephoned
to say that he would not be home before
dinner. So I came away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you spoken to Mr. Osborne <i>since</i> then
about the matter on which you called to see him that
evening?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because after that evening there was no longer
any need!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Well, to the more experienced officials in court this
explanation had an unusual sound, but to Winter,
who slowly but surely was gathering the threads of
the murder in the flat into his hands, it sounded like
a sentence of death; and to Clarke, too, who had in
his possession Rose de Bercy&#39;s diary taken from Pauline
Dessaulx, it sounded so amazing, that he could
scarce believe his ears.</p>

<p class="indent">However, the coroner nodded to Furneaux, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span>
Furneaux turned to Osborne&#39;s solicitor, who suddenly
resolved to ask no questions, so the dapper
little man seated himself again at the table&mdash;much
to the relief of the jury, who were impatient of any
red herring drawn across the trail of evidence that
led unmistakably to the millionaire.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, at last, appeared six witnesses who spoke,
no longer against, but for Osborne. Four were International
polo-players, and two were waiters at the
Ritz Hotel, and all were positive that at the hour
when Mrs. Bates saw her employer at home, <i>they</i>
saw him elsewhere&mdash;or some among them saw him,
and the others, without seeing him, knew that he was
elsewhere.</p>

<p class="indent">Against this unassailable testimony was the obviously
honest cabman, and Osborne&#39;s own housekeeper:
and the jury, level-headed men, fully inclined
to be just, though perhaps, in this instance, passionate
and prejudiced, weighed it in their hearts.</p>

<p class="indent">But Furneaux, to suit his own purposes, had contrived
that the tag of lace should come last; and
with its mute appeal for vengeance everything in
favor of Osborne was swept out of the bosom of
His Majesty&#39;s lieges, and only wrath and abhorrence
raged there.</p>

<p class="indent">Why, if he had actually killed Rose de Bercy,
Osborne should carry about that incriminating bit
of lace in his bag, no one seemed to stop to ask; but
when the dreadful thing was held up before his eyes,
the twelve good men and true looked at it and at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
each other, and a sort of shuddering abhorrence pervaded
the court.</p>

<p class="indent">Even the Italian Antonio, who had contrived to
be present as representing some obscure paper in
Paris&mdash;the very man who had put the lace into the
bag&mdash;shook his head over Osborne&#39;s guilt, being, as
it were, carried out of himself by the vigor and rush
of the mental hurricane which swept around him!</p>

<p class="indent">When Osborne, put into the box, repeated that
the &quot;celt&quot; was really his, this candor now won no
sympathy. When he said solemnly that the bit of
lace had been secreted among his belongings by some
unknown hand, the small company of men present in
court despised him for so childish a lie.</p>

<p class="indent">His spirit, as he stood in that box, exposed to the
animus of so many spirits, felt as if it was being
hurried by a kind of magnetic gale to destruction;
his fingers, his knees shivered, his voice cracked in
his throat; he could not keep his eyes from being
wild, his skin from being white, and in his heart
his own stupefied conscience accused him of the sin
that his brothers charged him with.</p>

<p class="indent">Though the jury soon ascertained from the coroner&#39;s
injunctions what their verdict had to be, they
still took twenty minutes to think of it. However,
they knew well that the coroner had spoken to them
under the suggestion of the police, who, no doubt,
would conduct their own business best; so in the
end they came in with the verdict of &quot;willful murder
committed by some person or persons unknown.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span>
And now it was the turn of the mob to have their
say. The vast crowd was kept in leash until they
were vouchsafed just a glimpse of Osborne, in the
midst of a mass of police guarding him, as he
emerged from the court to his automobile. Then
suddenly, as it were, the hoarse bellow of the storm
opened to roar him out of the universe&mdash;an overpowering
load of sound for one frail heart to bear
without quailing.</p>

<p class="indent">But if Osborne&#39;s heart quailed, there was one heart
there that did not quail, one smooth forehead that
suddenly flushed and frowned in opposition to a
world&#39;s current, and dared to think and feel alone.</p>

<p class="indent">As the mob yelped its execration, Rosalind Marsh
cried a protest of &quot;Shame, oh, shame!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For now her woman&#39;s bosom smote her with ruth,
and her compassion championed him, believed in him,
refused to admit that he could have been so base.
If she had been near him she would have raised her
veil, and gazed into his face with a steady smile!</p>

<p class="indent">As she was about to enter the carriage that awaited
her, someone said close behind her:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Marsh.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She looked round and saw a small man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know me,&quot; he said&mdash;&quot;Inspector Furneaux.
We have even met and spoken together before&mdash;you
remember the old man who traveled with you in the
train from Tormouth? That was myself in another
aspect.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His eyes smiled, though his voice was respectful,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
but Rosalind gave him the barest inch of condescension
in a nod.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, I wish to speak to you,&quot; he muttered hurriedly.
&quot;I cannot say when exactly&mdash;I am very
occupied just now&mdash;but soon.... To speak to
you, I think, in your own interests&mdash;if I may. But
I do not know your address.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Very coldly, hardly caring to try and understand
his motive, she mentioned the house in Porchester
Gardens. In another moment she was in her carriage.</p>

<p class="indent">When she reached home she saw in her mother&#39;s
face just a shadow of inquiry as to where she had
been driving during the forenoon; but Rosalind said
not a word of the inquest. She was, indeed, very
silent during the whole of that day and the next.
She was restless and woefully uneasy. Through
the night her head was full of strange thoughts, and
she slept but little, in fitful moments of weariness.
Her mother observed her with a quiet eye, pondering
this unwonted distress in her heart, but said nothing.</p>

<p class="indent">On the third morning Rosalind was sitting in a
rocking-chair, her head laid on the back, her eyes
closed; and with a motion corresponding with the gentle
to-and-fro motion of the chair her head moved
wearily from side to side. This went on for some time;
till suddenly she brought her hand to her forehead
in a rather excited gesture, her eyes opened with the
weak look of eyes dazzled with light, and she said
aloud:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span>
&quot;Oh, I <i>must</i>!...&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Now she sprang up in a hurry, hastened to an
escritoire, and dashed off a letter in a very scamper
of haste.</p>

<p class="indent">At last, then, the floods had broken their gates,
for this is what she wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="indent">My dear, my dear, I was brutal to you that night at the
sun-dial. But it was necessary, if I was to maintain the
severity which I felt that your lack of frankness to me
deserved. Inwardly there was a terribly weak spot, of which
I was afraid; and if you had come after me when I left you,
and had commanded me, or prayed me, or touched me, no
doubt it would have been all up with me. Forgive me, then,
if I seemed over harsh where, I&#39;m afraid, I am disposed to
be rather too infinitely lenient. At present, you see, I quite
lack the self-restraint to keep from telling you that I am
sorry for you.... I was present at the inquest.... Pity
is like lightning; it fills, it burns up, it enlightens ... see
me here struck with it!... You are not without a friend,
one who knows you, judges you, and acquits you.... If
you want to come to me, come!... I once thought well of
a Mr. Glyn, but, like a flirt, will forget him, if Osborne is of
the same manner, speaks with the same voice.... My
mother is usually good to me....</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">She enclosed it in a flurry of excitement, ran to
the bell-rope, rang, and while waiting for a servant
held the envelope in the manner of one who is on the
very point of tearing a paper in two, but halts to
see on which cheek the wind will hit. In the midst
of this suspense of indecision the door opened; and
now, straightway, she hastened to it, and got rid
of the letter, saying rapidly in a dropped voice, confidentially:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span>
&quot;Pauline, put that in the pillar-box at once for
me, will you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Another moment and she stood alone there, with a
shocked and beating heart, the deed done, past recall
now.</p>

<p class="indent">As for Pauline Dessaulx, she was half-way down
the stairs when she chanced to look at the envelope.
&quot;Rupert Osborne, Esq.&quot; She started! Everything
connected with that name was of infinite interest to
her! But she had not dreamt that Miss Marsh
knew it, save as everyone else knew it now, from
public gossip and the papers.</p>

<p class="indent">She had never seen Rosalind Marsh, or her mother,
till the day of their arrival from the country. It
was but ten days earlier that she had become the
servant of a Mrs. Prawser, a friend of Mrs. Marsh&#39;s,
who kept a private boarding-house, being in reduced
circumstances. Then, after but an interval of peace
and security, the Marshes had come, and as she let
them in, and they were being embraced by Mrs.
Prawser, Inspector Clarke had appeared at the
door, nearly striking her dead with agitation, and
demanding of her the diary, which she had handed
him.</p>

<p class="indent">Luckily, luckily, she had been wise enough before
that to scratch out with many thick scratches of
the pen the name that had been written by the actress
before the initials C. E. F. in that passage where
the words appeared: &quot;If I am killed this night it
will be by &mdash;&mdash; or by C. E. F.&quot; But suppose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
she had not shown such sense and daring, what then?
She shivered at the thought.</p>

<p class="indent">And a new problem now tortured her. Was it
somehow owing to the fact that Miss Marsh knew
Osborne that Inspector Clarke had come upon her
at the moment of the two ladies&#39; arrival? What
was the relation between Miss Marsh and Osborne?
What was in this letter? It might be well to
see....</p>

<p class="indent">Undecided, Pauline stood on the stairs some seconds,
letter in hand, all the high color fled from lips
and cheeks, her breast rising and falling, no mere
housemaid now, but a figure of anguish fit for an
artist to sketch there in her suspense, a well-molded
girl of perfect curves and graceful poise.</p>

<p class="indent">Then it struck her that Miss Marsh might be
looking out of the window to watch her hurrying
with the letter to the pillar-box a little way down
the street, and at this thought she ran downstairs
and out, hurried to the pillar-box, raised her arm
with the letter, inserted it in the slot, drew it out
swiftly and hiddenly again, slipped it into her pocket,
and sped back to the house.</p>

<p class="indent">In her rooms half an hour later she steamed the
envelope open, and read the avowal of another
woman&#39;s passion and sympathy. It appeared, then,
that Miss Marsh was now in love with Osborne? Well,
that did not specially interest or concern her, Pauline.
It was a good thing that Osborne had so soon
forgotten <i>cette salope</i>, Rose de Bercy. She, Pauline,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
had conceived a fondness for Miss Marsh; she
had detested her mistress, the dead actress. At the
first chance she crept afresh into the street, and
posted the letter in grim earnest. But an hour had
been lost, an hour that meant a great deal in the
workings of this tragedy of real life and, as a minor
happening, some of the gum was dissolved off the
flap of the envelope.</p>

<p class="indent">Inspector Furneaux, as he had promised after the
inquest, called upon Rosalind during the afternoon.
They had an interview of some length in Mrs. Prawser&#39;s
drawing-room, which was otherwise untenanted.
Furneaux spoke of the picturesqueness of Tormouth,
but Rosalind&#39;s downright questioning forced him to
speak of himself in the part of the decrepit Mr.
Pugh, and why he had been there as such. He had
gone to have a look at Osborne.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is his every step, then, spied on in this fashion?&quot;
asked Rosalind.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; answered Furneaux. &quot;The truth is that
I had had reason to think that the man was again
playing the lover in that quarter&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, playing,&quot; said Rosalind with quick sarcasm.
&quot;It is an insipid phrase for so serious an occupation.
But what reason had you for thinking that he was
playing in that particular mood?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The reason is immaterial.... In fact, he
had impressed on the back of a letter a name&mdash;I
may tell you it was &#39;Rosalind&#39;&mdash;and sent it off
inadvertently&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>
&quot;Oh, poor fellow! Not so skilled a villain then,
after all,&quot; she murmured.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But the point was that, if this was so, it was
clear to me that he could not be much good&mdash;I speak
frankly&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And with a good meaning to <i>you</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let us take it at that. It makes matters easier.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, as I suspected, so I found. And&mdash;I was
disgusted. I give you my assurance that he had
professed to Mademoiselle de Bercy that he&mdash;loved
her. He had, he had! And she, so pitifully handled,
so butchered, was hardly yet cold in her grave. Even
assuming his perfect innocence in that horrible
drama, still, I must confess, I&mdash;I&mdash;was disgusted;
I was put against the man forever. And I was more
than disgusted with him, I was concerned for the
lady whose inclinations such a weather-vane might
win. I was concerned before I saw you; I was ten
times more concerned afterwards. I travelled to
town in the same compartment as you&mdash;I heard your
voice&mdash;I enjoyed the privilege of breathing the same
air as you and your charming mother. Hence&mdash;I am
here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rosalind smiled. She found the detective&#39;s compliments
almost nauseating, but she must ascertain
his object.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, precisely?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want to warn you. I had warned you before:
for I had given a certain girl whose love Mr. Osborne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg&nbsp;164]</span>
has inspired a hint of what was going on, and I
felt sure that she would not fail to tell you who
&#39;Mr. Glyn&#39; was. Was I not right?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rosalind bent her head a little under this unexpected
thrust.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I received a note,&quot; she said. &quot;Who, then, is
this &#39;certain girl, whose love Mr. Osborne has inspired,&#39;
if one may ask?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I may tell you&mdash;in confidence. Her name is
Prout. She is his secretary.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is&mdash;successful in that way,&quot; observed Rosalind
coldly, looking down at a spray of flowers pinned
to her breast.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Too much so, Miss Marsh. Now, I felt confident
that the warning given by Miss Prout would effectually
quash any friendship between a lady of your
pride and quality and Mr. Glyn&mdash;Osborne. But
then, through your thick veil I noticed you at the
inquest: and I said to myself, &#39;I am older than she
is&mdash;I&#39;ll speak to her in the tone of an old and experienced
man, if she will let me.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see, I let you. I even thank you. But
then you notice that Mr. Osborne is just now vilified
and friendless.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, there is his Miss Prout.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rosalind&#39;s neck stiffened a little.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is indefinite,&quot; she said. &quot;I know nothing
of this lady, except that, as you tell me, she is ready
to betray her employer to serve her own ends. Mr.
Osborne is my friend: it is my duty to refuse to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span>
credit vague statements made against him. It is
not possible&mdash;it cannot be&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She stopped, rather in confusion. Furneaux believed
he could guess what she meant to say.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It <i>is</i> possible, believe me,&quot; he broke in earnestly.
&quot;Since it was possible, as you know, for him to turn
his mind so easily from the dead, it is also possible&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, the dead deceived him!&quot; she protested with
a lively flush. &quot;The dead was unworthy of him.
He never loved her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>He</i> deceived <i>her</i>,&quot; cried Furneaux also in an unaccountable
heat&mdash;&quot;he deceived her. No doubt she
was as fully worthy of him as he of her&mdash;it was
a pair of them. And he loved her as much as he
can love anyone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Women are said to be the best judges in such
matters, Inspector Furneaux.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So, then, you will not be guided by me in this?&quot;
Furneaux said, standing up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. Nevertheless, I thank you for your apparent
good intent,&quot; answered Rosalind.</p>

<p class="indent">He was silent a little while, looking down at her.
On her part, she did not move, and kept her eyes
studiously averted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then, for your sake, and to spite him, I
accuse him to you of the murder!&quot; he almost
hissed.</p>

<p class="indent">She smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is very wrong of you, very unlike an officer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span>
of the law. You know that he is quite innocent
of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Great, indeed, is your faith!&quot; came the taunt.
&quot;Well, then,&quot; he added suddenly, &quot;again for your
sake, and again to spite him, I will even let you into
a police secret. Hear it&mdash;listen to it&mdash;yesterday,
with a search-warrant, I raided Mr. Osborne&#39;s private
apartments. And this is what I found&mdash;at the bottom
of a trunk a suit of clothes, the very clothes which
the driver of the taxicab described as those of the man
whom he took from Berkeley Street to Feldisham
Mansions on the night of the murder. And those
clothes, now in the possession of the police, are all
speckled and spotted with blood. Come, Miss Marsh&mdash;what
do you say now? Is your trust weakened?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux&#39;s eyes sparkled with a glint of real
hatred of Osborne, but Rosalind saw nothing of that.
She rose, took an unsteady step or two, and stared
through the window out into the street. Then she
heard the door of the room being opened. She turned
at once. Before a word could escape her lips, Furneaux
was gone.</p>

<p class="indent">One minute later, she was scribbling with furious
speed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Do not read my letter. I will call for it&mdash;unopened&mdash;in
person.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Rosalind Marsh.</span></span><br />
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">She tugged at the bell-rope. When Pauline appeared,
she whispered: &quot;Quickly, Pauline, for my
sake&mdash;this telegram.&quot; And as Pauline ran with it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span>
she sank into a chair, and sat there with closed eyelids
and trembling lips, sorely stricken in her pride,
yet even more sorely in her heart.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, if her letter had gone by the post by which
she had sent it, Osborne would have read it two hours
or more before the telegram arrived. But it had
been kept back by Pauline: and, as it was, the letter
only arrived five minutes before the telegram.</p>

<p class="indent">At that moment Osborne was upstairs in his house.
The letter was handed to Hylda Prout in the library.
She looked at it, and knew the writing, for she had
found in Osborne&#39;s room at Tormouth a note of
invitation to luncheon from Rosalind to Osborne, and
did not scruple to steal it. A flood of jealousy now
stabbed her heart and inflamed her eyes. It was
then near five in the afternoon, and she had on a
silver tripod a kettle simmering for tea, for she was
a woman of fads, and held that the servants of the
establishment brewed poison. She quickly steamed
open the letter&mdash;which had been already steamed
open by Pauline&mdash;and, every second expecting Osborne
to enter, ran her eye through it. Then she
pressed down the flap of the envelope anew.</p>

<p class="indent">Two minutes afterwards Rupert made his appearance,
and she handed him the letter.</p>

<p class="indent">He started! He stared at it, his face at one
instant pale, at the next crimson. And as he so
stood, flurried, glad, agitated, there entered Jenkins
with a telegram on a salver.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it?&quot; muttered Osborne with a gesture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span>
of irritation, for he was not quite master of himself
in these days. Nevertheless, to get the telegram off
his mind at once before rushing upstairs to read the
letter in solitude, he snatched at it, tore it open, and
ran his eye over it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do not read my letter. I will call for it <i>unopened</i>....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He let his two hands drop in a palsy of anger, the
letter in one, the telegram in the other&mdash;bitter disappointment
in his heart, a wild longing, a mad
temptation....</p>

<p class="indent">He lifted the letter to allow his gaze to linger
futilely upon it, like Tantalus.... In spite of his
agitation he could not fail to see that the envelope
was actually open, for, as a matter of fact, the gum
had nearly all been steamed away....</p>

<p class="indent">It was open! He had but to put in his finger and
draw it out, and read, and revel, like the parched
traveler at the solitary well in the desert. Would
that be dishonest? Who could blame him for that?
He had not opened the envelope....</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Prout, just give me the gum-pot,&quot; he said,
for he could see that the gum on the flap was too thin
to be of any service.</p>

<p class="indent">Hylda Prout handed him a brush, and he pasted
down the flap, but with fingers so agitated that he
made daubs with the gum on the envelope, daubs
which anyone must notice on examination.</p>

<p class="indent">Meantime, he had dropped the telegram upon the
table, and Hylda Prout read it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br/>
THE DIARY, AND ROSALIND</h2>

<p class="indent">Strange as a process of nature is the way in which
events, themselves unimportant, work into one another
to produce some foredestined result that shall
astonish the world.</p>

<p class="indent">The sudden appearance of Inspector Clarke before
Pauline Dessaulx at the front door of Mrs. Marsh&#39;s
lodgings produced by its shock a thorough upset in
the girl&#39;s moral and physical being. And in Clarke
himself that diary of Rose de Bercy which Pauline
handed him produced a hilarity, an almost drunken
levity of mind, the results of which levity and of
Pauline&#39;s upset dovetailed one with the other to bring
about an effect which lost none of its singularity
because it was preordained.</p>

<p class="indent">To Clarke the diary was a revelation! Moreover,
it was one of those sweet revelations which placed the
fact of his own wit and wisdom in a clearer light
than he had seen those admitted qualities before, for
it showed that, though working in the dark, he had
been guided aright by that special candle of understanding
that must have been lit within him before
his birth.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span>
&quot;Well, fancy that,&quot; cried he again and again
in a kind of surprise. &quot;I was right all the
time!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He sat late at night, coatless and collarless, at
a table over the diary, Mrs. Clarke in the next room
long since asleep, London asleep, the very night
asleep from earth right up to heaven. Four days
before a black cat had been adopted into the household.
Surely it was <i>that</i> which had brought him
the luck to get hold of the diary!&mdash;so easily, so
unexpectedly. Pussie was now perched on the table,
her purr the sole sound in the quietude, and Clarke,
who would have scoffed at a hint of superstition,
was stroking her, as he read for the third time those
last pages written on the day of her death by the
unhappy Frenchwoman.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="indent">... I so seldom dream, that it has become the subject of
remark, and Dr. Naurocki of the Institute said once that it is
because I am such a &quot;perfect animal.&quot; It is well to be a
perfect <i>some</i>thing: but that much I owe only to my father
and mother. I am afraid I am not a perfect anything else.
A perfect liar, perhaps; a perfect adventuress; using as stepping-stones
those whose fond hearts love me; shallow, thin
within; made of hollow-ringing tin from my skin to the
tissue of my liver. Oh, perhaps I might have done better
for myself! Suppose I had stayed with Marguerite and <i>le
pre</i> Armaud on the farm, and helped to milk the two cows,
and met some rustic lover at the stile at dusk, and married
him in muslin? It might have been as well! There is something
in me that is famished and starved, and decayed, something
that pines and sighs because of its utter thinness&mdash;I
suppose it is what they call &quot;the soul.&quot; I have lied until I
am become a lie, an unreality, a Nothing. I seem to see myself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span>
clearly to-day; and if I could repent now, I&#39;d say &quot;I will
arise and go to my father, and will say to him &#39;Father.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Too late now, I suppose. Marguerite would draw her skirts
away from touching me, though the cut of the skirt would
set me smiling; and, if the fatted calf was set before me on
a soiled table-cloth, I should be ill.</p>

<p class="indent">Too late! You can&#39;t turn back the clock&#39;s hands: the clock
stops. God help me, I feel horribly remorseful. Why should I
have dreamt it? I so seldom dream! and I have <i>never</i>, I think,
dreamt with such living vividness. I thought I saw my father
and Marguerite standing over my dead body, staring at me.
I saw them, and I saw myself, and my face was all bruised
and wounded; and Marguerite said: &quot;Well, she sought for
it,&quot; and my father&#39;s face twitched, and suddenly he sobbed
out: &quot;I wish to Heaven I had died for her!&quot; and my dead
ears on the bed heard, and my dead heart throbbed just
once again at him, and then was dead for ever.</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Clarke did not know that he was reading literature,
but he did know that this was more exciting than
any story he had ever set eyes on. He stopped,
lit a pipe, and resumed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="indent">I saw it, I heard it, though it was in a black world that it
happened, a world all draped in crape; black, black. But
what is the matter with me to-day? Is there any other
woman so sad in this great city, I wonder? I have opened one
of the bottles of Old Veuve, so there are only seven left now;
and I have drunk two full glasses of it. But it has made no
difference; and I have to dine with Lady Knox-Florestan, and
go with her to the opera; and Osborne may be coming. They
will think me a death&#39;s-head, and catch melancholy from me
like a fever. I do not know why I dreamt it, and why I cannot
forget. It seems rather strange. Is anything going to
happen to me, really? Oh, inside this breast of mine there
is a bell tolling, and a funeral moving to the tomb this afternoon.
It is as if I had drunk of some lugubrious drug that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span>
turns the human bosom to wormwood. Is it my destiny to die
suddenly, and lie in an early grave? No, not that! Let me
be in rags, and shrunken, with old, old eyes and toothless
gums, but give me life! Let me say I am still alive!</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;By Jove!&quot; growled Clarke, chewing his pipe,
&quot;that rings in my ears!&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Yet I have had curious tokens, hints, fancies, of late. Four
nights ago, as I was driving down Pall Mall from Lady Sinclair&#39;s
<i>diner dansant</i>&mdash;it was about eleven-thirty&mdash;I saw a man
in the shadow at a corner who I could have sworn for a
moment was F. I didn&#39;t see his face, for as the carriage approached
him, he turned his back, and it was that turning of
the back, I think, that made me observe him. Suppose all the
time F. knows of me?&mdash;knows <i>who</i> Rose de Bercy <i>is</i>! I never
wanted to have that Academy portrait painted, and I must
have been mad to consent in the end. If F. saw it? If he
<i>knows</i>? What would he do? His nature is capable of ravaging
flames of passion! Suppose he killed me? But could a
poor woman be so unlucky? No, he doesn&#39;t know, he can&#39;t,
fate is not so hard. Then there is that wretched Pauline&mdash;she
shan&#39;t be in this house another week. My quarrel with
her this morning was the third, and the most bitter of all.
Really, that girl knows too much of me to permit of our living
any longer under one roof; and, what is more, she has twice
dropped hints lately which certainly seem to bear the interpretation
that she knows of my work in Berlin for the
Russian Government. Oh, but that must only be the madness
of my fancy! Two persons, and two only, in the whole world
know of it&mdash;how could <i>she</i>, possibly? Yet she said in her
Friday passion: &quot;You will not be a long liver, Madame, you
have been too untrue to your dupes.&quot; <i>Untrue to my dupes!</i>
Which dupes? My God, if she meant the Anarchists!</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Clarke&#39;s face was a study when he came to that
word. It wore the beatific expression of the man
who is justified in his own judgment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg&nbsp;173]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Just suppose that she knows! For that she is mixed up
with some of them to some uncertain extent I have guessed
for two years. And if they knew that I have actually been
a Government agent; they would do for me, oh, they would,
I know, it would be all up with me. Three months ago
Sauriac Paulus in the <i>promenoire</i> at Covent Garden, said to
me: &quot;By the way, do you know that you have been condemned
to death?&quot; I forget <i>à propos</i> of what he said it, and have
never given it a thought from that day. He was bantering
me, laughing in the lightest vein, but&mdash;God! it never struck me
like this before!&mdash;Suppose there was earnest under the jest,
deep-hidden under? He is a deep, deep, evil beast, that
man. Those were his words&mdash;I remember distinctly. &quot;By
the way, do you know that you have been condemned to
death?&quot; &quot;By the way:&quot; his heavy face shook with chuckling.
And it never once till now entered my head!&mdash;Oh, but, after
all, I must be horribly ill to be having such thoughts this
day! The beast, of course, didn&#39;t mean anything. Think,
though, of saying, &quot;by the way?&quot;&mdash;the terrible, evil beast.
Oh, yes, I am ill. I have begun to die. This night, may be,
my soul shall be required of me. I hear Marguerite saying
again, &quot;Well, she sought for it,&quot; and my father&#39;s bitter sobbing,
&quot;I wish to Heaven I had died for her!&quot; But, if I am killed
this day, it will be by ... or by C. E. F....</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">That last dash after the &quot;F.&quot; was not, Clarke
saw, meant as a dash, for it was a long curved line,
as if her elbow had been struck, or she herself violently
startled. She had probably intended, this time,
to write the name in full, but the interruption stopped
her.</p>

<p class="indent">At the spot of the first dash lay thick ink-marks&mdash;really
made by Pauline Dessaulx&mdash;and Clarke, cute
enough to see this, now commenced to scratch out the
ink blot with a penknife, and after the black dust
was scraped away, he used a damp sponge.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span>
It was a delicate, slow operation, his idea being
that, since under those layers of ink lay a written
name, if he removed the layers with dainty care, then
he would see the name beneath. And this was no
doubt true in theory, but in practice no care was
dainty enough to do the trick with much success.
He did, however, manage to see the shape of some
letters, and, partly with the aid of his magnifying
glass, partly with the aid of his imagination, he
seemed to make out the word &quot;<i>Janoc</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The murder, then, was committed either by Janoc,
or by C. E. F.&mdash;this, as the mantle of the night
wore threadbare, and some gray was showing through
it in the east, Clarke became certain of.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Who</i> was C. E. F.? There was Furneaux, of
course. Those were his initials, and as the name
of Furneaux arose in his mind, Clarke&#39;s head dropped
back over his chair-back, and a long, delicious spasm
of laughter shook him. For the idea that it <i>might</i>,
in very truth, be Furneaux who was meant never
for one instant occurred to him. He assumed that
it must needs be some French or Russian C. E. F.,
but the joke of the coincidence of the initials with
Furneaux&#39;s, who had charge of the case, into whose
hands the case had been given by Winter over his
(Clarke&#39;s) head, was so rich, that he resolved to show
the diary to Winter, and to try and keep from bursting
out laughing, while he said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look here, sir&mdash;this is your Furneaux!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Clarke, indeed, had heard at the inquest how Furneaux
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span>
had been seen on the evening of the murder in
Osborne&#39;s museum, from which the &quot;celt&quot; and the
dagger had vanished. Hearing this, his mind had
instantly remembered the &quot;C. E. F.&quot; of the diary,
and had been amazed at such a coincidence. But
his brain never sprang to grapple with the possibility
that Rose de Bercy might, in truth, be afraid of
Furneaux. So, whoever &quot;C. E. F.&quot; might be, Clarke
had no interest in him, never suspected him: his
thoughts had too long been preoccupied with one
idea&mdash;Anarchists, Janoc, Anarchists&mdash;to receive a
new bent with real perspicacity and interest. And
the diary confirmed him in this opinion: for she had
actually been condemned to death as an agent of the
Russian Government months before. At last he
stood up, stretching his arms in weariness before
tumbling into bed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well! to think that I was right!&quot; he said again,
and again he laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">When he was going out in the morning, he put
some more ink-marks over the &quot;Janoc&quot; in the diary&mdash;for
he did not mean that any other than himself
should lay his hand on the murderer of Rose de
Bercy&mdash;and when he arrived at Scotland Yard, he
showed the diary to the Chief Inspector.</p>

<p class="indent">Winter laid it on the desk before him, and as he
read where Clarke&#39;s finger pointed, his face went as
colorless as the paper he was looking at.</p>

<p class="indent">A laugh broke out behind him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Furneaux!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg&nbsp;176]</span>
And Winter, glancing round, saw Clarke&#39;s face
merry, like carved ivory in a state of gayety, showing
a tooth or two lacking, and browned fangs. For
a moment he stared at Clarke, without comprehension,
till the absurd truth rushed in upon him that
Clarke was really taking it in jest. Then he, too,
laughed even more loudly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ha! ha!&mdash;yes, Furneaux! &#39;Pon my honor, the
funniest thing! Furneaux it is for sure!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Officer in charge of the case!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ripping! By gad, I shall have to apply for a
warrant!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Finding his chief in this rare good humor, Clarke
thought to obtain a little useful information.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you know any of the Anarchist crowd with
those initials, sir?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think I do; yes, a Frenchman. Or it may be
a German. There is no telling whom she means&mdash;no
telling. But where on earth did you come across
this diary?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You remember the lady&#39;s-maid, Pauline, the girl
who couldn&#39;t be found to give evidence at the inquest?
I was following the Anarchist Antonio, who seemed
to be prowling after some ladies in a cab a day or
two ago, and the door that was opened to the ladies
when their cab stopped was opened by&mdash;Pauline.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then he told how he had obtained the diary, and
volunteered a theory as to the girl&#39;s possession
of it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She must have picked it up in the flat on coming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span>
home from the Exhibition on the night of the murder,
and kept it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They discussed the circumstances fully, and Clarke
went away, his conscience clear of having kept the
matter dark from headquarters, yet confident that
he had not put Winter on the track of his own special
prey, Janoc. And as his footsteps became faint
and fainter behind the closed door, Winter let his
head fall low, almost upon the desk, and so he remained,
hidden, as it were, from himself, a long while,
until suddenly springing up with a face all fiery, he
cried aloud in a rage:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no more sentiment! By the Lord, I&#39;m done
with it. From this hour Inspector Furneaux is
under the eye of the police.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux himself was then, for the second time
that week, at Mrs. Marsh&#39;s lodgings in Porchester
Gardens in secret and urgent talk with Rosalind.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will think that I am always hunting you
down, Miss Marsh,&quot; he said genially on entering the
room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know best how to describe your profession,&quot;
she murmured a little bitterly, for his parting shot
at their last meeting had struck deep.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But this time I come more definitely on business,&quot;
he said, seating himself uninvited, which was a
strange thing for Furneaux to do, since he was a
gentleman by birth and in manners, &quot;and as I am
in a whirl of occupation just now, I will come at
once to the point.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span>
&quot;To say &#39;I will come at once to the point&#39; is
to put off coming to it&mdash;for while you are saying
it&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;True. The world uses too many words&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is a round world&mdash;hence its slowness in coming
to a point.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I take the hint. Yet you leave me rather breathless.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pray tell me why, Inspector Furneaux.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For admiration of so quick and witty a lady.
But I shall make you dumb by what I am going to
suggest to-day. I want to turn you into a detective&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It <i>is</i> a point, then. You want me to be sharp?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are already that. The question is, what
effect did what I last said have upon your mind?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;About your finding the blood-spotted clothes in
Mr. Osborne&#39;s trunk?&quot; she asked, looking down at
his tired and worn face from her superior height, and
suddenly moved to listen to him attentively. &quot;Well,
it was somewhat astounding at first. In fact, it
sounded almost convincing. But then, I had already
believed in Mr. Osborne&#39;s innocence in this matter.
Nor am I over-easily shaken, I think, in my convictions.
If he confessed his guilt to me, then I
would believe&mdash;but not otherwise.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good,&quot; said Furneaux, &quot;you have said that well,
though I am sure he does not deserve it. Anyhow,
since you persist in believing in his innocence, you
must also believe that every new truth must be in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
his favor, and so may be willing to turn yourself
into the detective I suggested.... You have, I
think, a servant here named Pauline Dessaulx?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This girl he had been seeking for some time, and
had been gladly surprised to have her open the door
to him on the day of his first visit to Rosalind. &quot;She
did not know me,&quot; he explained, &quot;but <i>I</i> have twice
seen her in the streets with her former mistress.
Do you know who that mistress was? Rose de
Bercy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rosalind started as though a whip had cracked
across her shoulders. She even turned round, looked
at the door, tested it by the handle to see if it was
closed, and stood with her back to it. Furneaux
seemingly ignored her agitation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, you were at the inquest, Miss Marsh,&quot; he
said. &quot;You heard the description given by Miss
Prout of the Saracen dagger missing from Mr Osborne&#39;s
museum&mdash;the dagger with which the crime
was probably committed. Well, I want to get that
into my hands. It is lying in Pauline Dessaulx&#39;s
trunk, and I ask you to secure it for me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In Pauline&#39;s trunk,&quot; Rosalind repeated after him,
quite too dazed in her astonishment to realize the
marvels that this queer little man was telling her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To be quite accurate,&quot; he continued, &quot;I am not
altogether sure of what I say. But that is where it
<i>should</i> be, in her trunk, and with it you should find
a second dagger, or knife, which I am also anxious
to obtain, and if you happen to come across a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
book, a diary, with a blue morocco cover, I shall be
extremely pleased to lay my hand on it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How can you possibly know all this?&quot; Rosalind
asked, her eyes wide open with wonder now, and
forgetful, for the moment, of the pain he had caused
her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Going up and down in the earth, like Satan, and
then sitting and thinking of it,&quot; he said, with a quick
turn of mordant humor. &quot;But is it a bargain, now?
Of course, I could easily pounce upon the girl&#39;s trunk
myself: but I want the objects to be <i>stolen</i> from her,
since I don&#39;t wish to have her frightened&mdash;not quite
yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you, then, suspect this girl of having&mdash;of
being&mdash;the guilty hand, Inspector Furneaux?&quot;
asked Rosalind, her very soul aghast at the notion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have already intimated to you the person who
is open to suspicion,&quot; answered Furneaux promptly,
&quot;a man, not a woman&mdash;though, if you find these
objects in the girl&#39;s trunk, that <i>may</i> lighten the
suspicion against the man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A gleam appeared one instant in his eyes, and died
out as quickly, but this time Rosalind saw it. She
pulled a chair close to him and sat down, her fingers
clasped tightly over her right knee&mdash;eager to serve,
to help. But, then, to steal, to pry into a servant&#39;s
boxes, that was not a nice action. And this Pauline
Dessaulx was a girl who had interested her, had
shown a singular liking for her.</p>

<p class="indent">She mentioned her qualms.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>
&quot;At the bidding of the police,&quot; urged Furneaux&mdash;&quot;in
the interests of justice&mdash;to serve a possibly
innocent man, who is also a friend&mdash;surely that is
something.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I might have been able to do it yesterday,&quot; murmured
Rosalind, distraught, &quot;but she is better to-day.
I will tell you. For two days the girl has
been ill&mdash;in a kind of hysteria or nervous collapse&mdash;a
species of neurosis, I think&mdash;altogether abnormal
and strange. I&mdash;you may as well know&mdash;wrote a
letter to Mr. Osborne on the day you first came,
a little before you came. I gave it her to post&mdash;she
may have seen the address. Then you appeared.
After you were gone, I sent him a telegram, also
by Pauline&#39;s hand, telling him not to read my
letter&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, you see you did believe that what I told
you proved his guilt&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hear me.... No, I did not believe that.
But&mdash;you had impressed me with the fact that Mr.
Osborne has been, may have been, already sufficiently
successful in attracting the sympathies of young
ladies. I had been at the inquest&mdash;I had seen there
in the box his exquisite secretary, of whose perfect
ways of acting you gave me some knowledge that
day, and I thought it might be rash of me to seem
to be in rivalry with so charming a lady. Now you
see my motive&mdash;I am often frank. So, when you
were gone, I sent the telegram forbidding the reading
of my letter; and the next morning I received a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span>
brief note from Mr. Osborne saying that the letter
was awaiting my wishes unopened.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How did he know your address, if he did not
open the letter?&quot; asked Furneaux.</p>

<p class="indent">Rosalind started like a child caught in a fault.
She was so agitated that she had not asked herself
that question. As a matter of fact, it was Hylda
Prout, having tracked Rosalind from Waterloo, who
had given Osborne the address for her own reasons:
Hylda had told Osborne, on hearing his fretful exclamation
of annoyance, that she knew the address
of a Miss Marsh from an old gentleman who had
apparently come up from Tormouth with him and
her, and had called to see Osborne when Osborne was
out.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He got the address from some source, I don&#39;t
know what,&quot; Rosalind said, with a rather wondering
gaze at Furneaux&#39;s face; &quot;but the point is, that the
girl, Pauline, saw my letter to him, and the telegram;
and last night, coming home from an outing in quite
a broken-down and enfeebled state, she said to me
with tears in her eyes: &#39;Oh, he is innocent! Oh, do
not judge him harshly, Miss Marsh! Oh, it was
not he who did it!&#39; and much more of that sort.
Then she collapsed and began to scream and kick,
was got to bed, and a doctor sent for, who said that
she had an attack of neurasthenia due to mental
strain. And I was sitting by her bedside quite a
long while, so that I might then&mdash;if I had known&mdash;But
I think she is better to-day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span>
&quot;It is not too late, if she is still in bed,&quot; said
Furneaux. &quot;Sit with her again till she is asleep,
and then see if the trunk is unlocked, or if you can
find the key&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only it doesn&#39;t seem quite fair to&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, quite, in this case, I assure you,&quot; said Furneaux.
&quot;Whether this girl committed that murder
with her own hand or not&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But how <i>could</i> she? She was at an Exhibition&mdash;&mdash;!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was she? Are you sure? I was saying that
whether the girl committed the murder with her own
hand or not&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If <i>she</i> did, it could not have been done by the
person you said that you suspect!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No? Why speak so confidently? Have you
not heard of such things as accomplices? She
might have helped Osborne! <i>He</i> might have helped
<i>her</i>! But I was saying&mdash;for the third time&mdash;that
whether the girl committed the murder with her own
hand or not, I am in a position to give you my assurance
that she is not a lawful citizen, and that you
needn&#39;t have the least compunction in doing anything
whatever to her trunk or her&mdash;in the cause of
truth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, if you say so&mdash;&mdash;&quot; Rosalind said, and
Furneaux stood up to go.</p>

<p class="indent">It was then two o&#39;clock in the afternoon. By
five o&#39;clock Rosalind had in her hand the Saracen
dagger, and another dagger&mdash;though not, of course,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
the diary, which Clarke had carried off long
ago.</p>

<p class="indent">At about three she had gone to sit by Pauline&#39;s
bedside, and here, with the leather trunk strapped
down, not two feet from her right hand, had remained
over an hour. Pauline lay quiet, with a
stare in her wide-open eyes, gazing up at the ceiling.
Every now and again her body would twist into a
gawky and awkward kind of position, a stupid expression
would overspread her face, a vacant smile
play on her lips; then, after some minutes, she would
lie naturally again, staring at the ceiling.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly, about half-past four, she had had a
kind of seizure; her body stiffened and curved, she
uttered shrieks which chilled Rosalind&#39;s blood, and
then her whole frame settled into a steady, strong
agitation, which set the chamber all in a tremble,
and could not be stilled by the two servants who had
her wrists in their grip. When this was over, she
dropped off into a deep sleep.</p>

<p class="indent">And now, as soon as Rosalind was again left
alone with the invalid, she went to the trunk, unstrapped
it, found it locked. But she was not long
in discovering the key in the pocket of the gown
which Pauline had had on when she fell ill. She
opened the trunk, looking behind her at the closed
eyes of the exhausted girl, and then, in feverish
haste, she ransacked its contents. No daggers, however,
and no diary were there. She then searched
methodically through the room&mdash;an improvised wardrobe&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span>
painted chest of drawers&mdash;kneaded and felt
the bed, searched underneath&mdash;no daggers. She
now stood in the middle of the room, her forehead
knit, her eyes wandering round, all her woman&#39;s
cunning at work in them. Then she walked straight,
with decision, to a small shelf on the wall, full of
cheap books; began to draw out each volume, and
on drawing out the third, she saw that the daggers
were lying there behind the row.</p>

<p class="indent">Her hand hovered during some seconds of hesitancy
over the horrible blades, one of which had so
lately been stained so vilely. Then she took them,
and replaced the books. One of the daggers was
evidently the Saracen weapon that she had heard
described. The label was still on it; the other was
thick-bladed, of an Italian type. She ran out with
them, put them in a glove box, and, rather flurriedly,
almost by stealth, got out of the house to take her
trophies to Furneaux.</p>

<p class="indent">She drove to the address that he had given her, an
eagerness in her, a gladness that the truth would
now appear, and through <i>her</i>&mdash;most unexpectedly!
Quite apart from her friendship for Osborne, she
had an abstract interest in this matter of the murder,
since from the first, before seeing Osborne, she had
said that he was innocent, but her mother had seemed
to lean to the opposite belief, and they were in hostile
camps on the subject, like two good-natured people
of different political convictions dwelling in the same
house.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
She bade her driver make haste to Furneaux&#39;s;
but midway, seeing herself passing close to Mayfair,
gave the man Osborne&#39;s address, thinking that she
would go and get her unopened letter, and, if she
saw Osborne himself, offer him a word of cheer&mdash;an
&quot;all will be well.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her driver rapped for her at the house door, she
sitting still in the cab, a hope in her that Osborne
would come out. It seemed long since she had last
seen his face, since she had heard that sob of his
at the sun-dial at the Abbey. The message went
inwards that Miss Marsh had called for a letter
directed to Mr. Osborne by her; and her high spirits
were damped when Jenkins reappeared at the door
to say that the letter would be brought her, Mr.
Osborne himself having just gone out.</p>

<p class="indent">In sober fact, Osborne had not stirred out of the
house for days, lest her promised call &quot;in person&quot;
should occur when he was absent, but at last, unable
to bear it any longer, he had made a dash to see
her, and was at that moment venturing to knock at
her door.</p>

<p class="indent">However, though the news was damping, she had
a store of high spirits that afternoon, which pushed
her to leave a note scribbled with her gold pencil
on the back of a letter&mdash;an act fraught with terrible
sufferings for her in the sequel. This was her message:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">I will write again. Meantime, do not lose hope! I have
discovered that your purloined dagger has been in the possession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
of the late lady&#39;s-maid, Pauline. &quot;A small thing, but
mine own!&quot; I am now taking it to Inspector Furneaux&#39;s.</p>
<p class="right">R. M.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;What <i>will</i> he think of &#39;<i>I</i> have discovered&#39;?&quot; she
asked herself, smiling, pleased; &quot;he will say &#39;a
witch&#39;!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She folded it crossways with a double bend so
that it would not open, and leaning out of the cab,
handed it to Jenkins.</p>

<p class="indent">As he disappeared with it, Hylda Prout stood
in the doorway with Rosalind&#39;s letter to Osborne&mdash;Hylda&#39;s
freckles showing strong against her rather
pale face. She held the flap-side of the envelope
forward from the first, to show the stains of gum
on it.</p>

<p class="indent">As she approached the cab, Rosalind&#39;s neck stiffened
a little. Their eyes met malignly, and dwelt
together several seconds, in a stillness like that of
somber skies before lightnings fly out. Truly, Rupert
Osborne&#39;s millions were unable to buy him either
happiness or luck, for it was the worst of ill-luck
that he should not have been at home just then.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg&nbsp;188]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br/>
ENTRAPPED!</h2>

<p class="indent">When Rosalind&#39;s contemptuous eyes abandoned
that silent interchange of looks, they fell upon the
envelope in Hylda Prout&#39;s hand, nor could she help
noticing that round the flap it was clumsily stained
with gum. Yet Osborne had written her saying that
it had been unopened....</p>

<p class="indent">The other woman stepped to the door of the cab.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Marsh?&quot; she inquired, with an assumed
lack of knowledge that was insolent in itself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Osborne left this for you, if you called.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The business was ended, yet the lady-secretary still
stood there, staring brazenly at Rosalind&#39;s face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Drive on&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rosalind raised her gloved hand to attract the
driver&#39;s attention.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One moment, Miss Marsh,&quot; said Hylda, also
raising a hand to forbid him to move; &quot;I want to
tell you something&mdash;You are very anxious on poor
Mr. Osborne&#39;s behalf, are you not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought he was rich? You are not to say
&#39;poor Mr. Osborne.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span>
&quot;Is that why you are so anxious, because he is
rich?&quot; and those golden-brown eyes suddenly blazed
out outrageously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Driver, go on, please!&quot; cried Rosalind again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wait, cabman!&quot; cried Hylda imperiously....
&quot;Stay a little&mdash;Miss Marsh&mdash;one word&mdash;I cannot
let you waste your sympathies as you do. You
believe that Mr. Osborne is friendless; and you offer
him your friendship&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>I!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rosalind laughed a little, a laugh with a dangerous
chuckle in it that might have carried a warning to
one who knew her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you not say so in that letter? In it you tell
him that since the night at the sun-dial, when you
were &#39;<i>brutal</i>&#39; to him&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know, then, my letter&mdash;by heart?&quot; said
Rosalind, her eyes sparkling and cheeks aflame.
&quot;That is quite charming of you! You have been
at the pains to read it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, of course, Mr. Osborne wouldn&#39;t exactly
<i>show</i> it to me, nor did I ask him. But I think you
guess that I am in Mr. Osborne&#39;s confidence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Osborne, it would seem, has&mdash;read it? He
even thought the contents of sufficient importance to
repeat them to his typist? Is that so?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Osborne repeats many things to me, Miss
Marsh&mdash;by habit. You being a stranger to him,
do not know him well yet, but I have been with him
some time, you see. As to his reading it, I know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
that you telegraphed him not to, and he received the
telegram before the letter, I admit; but, the letter
once in his hand, it became his private property, of
course. He had a right to read it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A stone in Rosalind&#39;s bosom where her heart had
been ached like a wound; yet her lips smiled&mdash;a hard
smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But then, having read, to be at the pains to seal
it down again!&quot; she said. &quot;It seems superfluous,
a contemptible subterfuge.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, well,&quot; sneered Hylda, with a pouting laugh,
&quot;he is not George Washington&mdash;a little harmless
deception.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you cry out all his secrets!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why to me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I save you from troubling your head about him.
He is not so friendless as you have imagined.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Happy man! And was it you who wrote me the
anonymous information that he was not Glyn but
Osborne?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, that was someone else.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And now Rosalind, blighting her with her icy
smile, which no inward fires could melt, said contemplatively:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am afraid you are not speaking the truth.
I shall tell Mr. Osborne to get rid of you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The dart was well planted. The paid secretary&#39;s
lips twitched and quivered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Try it! He&#39;ll laugh at you!&quot; she retorted.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span>
&quot;No, I think he will do it&mdash;to please me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sad to relate, our gracious Rosalind was deliberately
adding oil to the fires of hate and rage that
she saw devouring Hylda Prout; and when Hylda
again spoke it was from a fiery soul that peered out
of a ghost&#39;s face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will he?&mdash;to please you?&quot; she said low, hissingly,
leaning forward. &quot;He has a record in a diary of
the girls he has kissed, and the number of
days from the first sight to the first kiss. He only
wanted to see in how few days he could secure
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This vulgarity astonished its hearer. Rosalind
shrank a little; her smile became forced and strained;
she could only murmur:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you needn&#39;t be so bourgeoise.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hylda chuckled again maliciously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s the mere truth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Still, I think I shall warn him against you, and
have you dismissed,&quot;&mdash;this with that feminine instinct
of the dagger that plunged deepest, the lash
that cut most bitterly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You try!&quot; hissed Hylda sharply, as it were
secretly, with a nod of menace. &quot;I am not anybody!
I am not some defenseless housemaid, the
only rival you have experienced hitherto, perhaps.
I am&mdash;at any rate, you try! You dare! Touch
me, and I&#39;ll wither your arm&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Drive on!&quot; cried Rosalind almost in a scream.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wait!&quot; shrilled Hylda&mdash;&quot;you <i>shall</i> hear me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg&nbsp;192]</span>
&quot;Cabman, please&mdash;&mdash;!&quot; wailed Rosalind despairingly.</p>

<p class="indent">And now at last the cab was off, Hylda Prout
running with it to pant into it some final rancor;
and when it left her, she remained there on the pavement
a minute, unable to move, trembling from head
to foot, watching the vehicle as it sped away from
her.</p>

<p class="indent">When she re-entered the library the first thing
that she saw was Rosalind&#39;s cross-folded note to
Osborne, and, still burning inwardly, she snatched
it up, tore it open, and read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="indent">I will write again. Meantime, high hope! <i>I</i> have discovered
that your purloined dagger has been in the possession of the
late lady&#39;s-maid, Pauline. &quot;A small thing but mine own.&quot;
I am now taking it to Inspector Furneaux&#39;s.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">R. M.</span><br />
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Hylda dashed the paper to the ground, put her
foot on it, then catching it up, worried it in her
hands to atoms which she threw into a waste-paper
basket. Then she collapsed into a chair
at her desk, her arms thrown heedlessly over
some documents, and her face buried between
them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have gone too far, too far, too far&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Now that her passion had burnt to ashes this was
her thought. A crisis, it was clear, had come, and
something had to be done, to be decided, now&mdash;that
very day. Rosalind would surely tell Osborne what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span>
she, Hylda, had said, how she had acted, and then
all would be up with Hylda, no hope left, her whole
house in ruins about her, not one stone left standing
on another. Either she must bind Osborne irrevocably
to her at once, or her brain must devise some
means of keeping Osborne and Rosalind from meeting&mdash;or
both. But how achieve the apparently impossible?
Osborne, she knew, was at that moment
at Rosalind&#39;s residence, and if Rosalind was now
going home ... they would meet! Hylda moved
her buried head from side to side, woe-ridden, in
the grip of a hundred fangs and agonies. She had
boasted to Rosalind that she was not a whimpering
housemaid, but of a better texture: and if that was
an actual truth, the present moment must prove it.
Yet she sat there with a buried head, weakly weeping....</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly she thought of the words in Rosalind&#39;s
note to Osborne, which she had thrown into the
basket: &quot;I have discovered that your purloined dagger
has been in the possession of the late lady&#39;s-maid,
Pauline.... I am now taking it to Inspector Furneaux&#39;s....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">That, then, was the person who had the dagger
which had been so sought and speculated about&mdash;Pauline
Dessaulx!</p>

<p class="indent">And at the recollection of the name, Hylda&#39;s racked
brain, driven to invent, invented like lightning. Up
she sprang, caught at her hat, and rushed away,
pinning it on to her magnificent red hair in her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg&nbsp;194]</span>
flight, her eyes staring with haste. In the street
she leapt into a motor-cab&mdash;to Soho.</p>

<p class="indent">She was soon there. As if pursued by furies she
pelted up two foul staircases, and at a top back room,
rapped pressingly, fiercely, with the clenched
knuckles of both hands upon the panels. As a man
in his shirt-sleeves, his braces dropped, smoking a
cigarette, opened the door to her, she almost fell
in on him, and the burning words burst from her
tongue&#39;s tip:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Antonio!&mdash;it&#39;s all up with Pauline&mdash;the dagger
she did it with&mdash;has been found&mdash;by a woman&mdash;the
same woman from Tormouth whom you and I tracked
to Porchester Gardens&mdash;Pauline is in her employ
probably&mdash;tell Janoc&mdash;he has wits&mdash;he may do something
before it is too late&mdash;the woman has the dagger&mdash;in
a motor-cab&mdash;in a long, narrow box&mdash;she
is this instant taking it to Inspector Furneaux&#39;s
house&mdash;if <i>she</i> lives, Pauline hangs&mdash;tell Janoc that,
Antonio&mdash;don&#39;t stare&mdash;tell Janoc&mdash;it is <i>she</i> or Pauline&mdash;let
him choose&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Grand Dieu!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t stare&mdash;don&#39;t stand&mdash;I&#39;m gone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She ran out; and almost as she was down the
stair Antonio had thrown on a coat and was flying
down behind her.</p>

<p class="indent">He ran down three narrow streets to Poland Street,
darted up a stair, broke into a room; and there on
the floor, stretched face downwards, lay the lank
length of Janoc&#39;s body, a map of Europe spread
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg&nbsp;195]</span>
before him, on which with an ivory pointer he was
marking lines from town to town. He glanced at
the intruder with a frowning brow, yet he was up
like an acrobat, as the tidings leapt off Antonio&#39;s
tongue.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Found!&quot; he whispered hoarsely, &quot;Pauline
found!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and the dagger found, too!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Found! dearest of my heart! my sweet sister!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Janoc clasped to his bosom a phantom form, and
kissed thrice at the air.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and the dagger found that she did it
with&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The dagger?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and the lady is this minute taking it to
Inspector Furneaux&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lady?&mdash;Oh, found! found! dear, sweet sister,
why didst thou hide thyself from me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Janoc spread his arms with a face of rapture.
He could only assimilate the one great fact in his
joy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But Janoc&mdash;listen&mdash;the lady&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lady?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The lady who has the dagger! Listen, my
friend&mdash;she is on the way to Inspector Furneaux
with Pauline&#39;s dagger&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Mille diables!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Janoc, what is to be done? O, arouse yourself,
<i>pour l&#39;amour de Dieu</i>&mdash;Pauline will be hanged&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hanged? Yes! They hang women, I know,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span>
in England&mdash;the only country in Europe&mdash;this ugly
nest of savages. Yes! they hang them by the neck
on the gallows here&mdash;the gallant gentlemen! But
they won&#39;t hang <i>her</i>, Antonio! Let them touch her,
and <i>I</i>, I set all England dancing like a sandstorm
of the Sahara! Furneaux&#39;s house No. 12?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And the lady&#39;s address?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Porchester Gardens&mdash;unfortunately I did not
notice the number of the house.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pity: weak. What is she like, this lady?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Middle-size&mdash;plentiful brown hair&mdash;eyes blue&mdash;beautiful
in the cold English way, elegant, too&mdash;yes,
a pretty woman&mdash;I saw her in Tormouth&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come with me&quot;&mdash;and Janoc was in action, with
a suddenness, a fury, a contrast with his previous
stillness of listening that was very remarkable&mdash;as
if he had waited for the instant of action to sound,
and then said: &quot;Here it is! I am ready!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Out stretched his long leg, as he bent forward
into running, catching at his cap and revolver with
one sweep of his right arm, and at Antonio with a
snatch of the left; and from that moment his
motions were in the tone of the forced marches of
Napoleon&mdash;not an instant lost in the business he
was at.</p>

<p class="indent">He took Antonio in a cab to Furneaux&#39;s house
in Sinclair Street. There he was nudged by Antonio,
as they drove up, with a hysterical sob of
&quot;See! There she is!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span>
Rosalind was driving away at the moment. She
had, then, seen Furneaux? told Furneaux? given
Furneaux the dagger? In that case, the battle
would lie between Furneaux and Janoc that day.
Janoc&#39;s flesh was pale, but it was the paleness of
iron, his eyes were full of fire. In his heart he was
a hero, in brain and head an assassin!</p>

<p class="indent">He alighted at the detective&#39;s house, letting Rosalind
go. But the landlady of the flat told him
that Furneaux had not been at home for two hours,
and was not expected for another hour. Rosalind,
then, had not seen him; and the battle swung back
to its first ground as between Rosalind and Janoc.
Had the lady who had just called left any parcel,
or any weapon for Mr. Furneaux? The answer was
&quot;No.&quot; He hurried down into his cab, to make for
Rosalind&#39;s boarding-house.</p>

<p class="indent">But Antonio had not noted the number, and, to
discover it, Janoc started off to Osborne&#39;s house, to
ask it of Miss Prout.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, Rosalind was herself driving to the same
place. On learning that Furneaux was not at home,
she had paced his sitting-room a little while, undecided
whether to wait, or to leave a message and
go home. Then the new impulse had occurred in
her to go to Osborne&#39;s in the meantime, and then
return to Furneaux. Hylda Prout had contrived
to put a lump in her throat and a firebrand in her
bosom, an arrogance, a hot rancor. How much
of what the hussy had said against Osborne might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span>
contain some truth she did not know; it had so
scorched her, and inflamed her gorge, and kindled
her eyes, that she had not had time to question its
probability in her preoccupation with the gall and
smart of it. But that Osborne should have opened
the letter, and then written to say he had not&mdash;this
was a vileness that the slightest reflection found
to be incredible. The creature with the red hair
certainly knew what was in the letter, but&mdash;might
she not have opened it herself? And if any part
of her statements were false, <i>all</i> might be false. An
impatience to see Osborne instantly seized and transported
Rosalind. He had honest eyes&mdash;had she not
whispered it many a time to her heart? She hurried
off to him.... And by accident Janoc went after
her.</p>

<p class="indent">Osborne himself had arrived home some ten minutes
before this, after a very cold reception from Mrs.
Marsh at Porchester Gardens.</p>

<p class="indent">As he entered the library, he saw Hylda Prout
standing in the middle of the room with a face of
ecstasy which astonished him. She, lately arrived
back from her visit to the Italian, had heard him
come, and had leapt up to confront him, her heart
galloping in her throat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anything wrong?&quot; he asked with a quick glance
at her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Marsh has been here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah?... Miss Marsh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She made a mad step toward him. The words
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span>
that she uttered rasped harshly. She did not recognize
her own voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I told her straight out that it is not the slightest
good her running after you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You told her <i>what</i>?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Amazement struggled with indignation in his face.
All the world seemed to have gone mad when the
pale, studiously sedate secretary used such words of
frenzy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I meant to stop&mdash;her pursuit of you.... Mr.
Osborne&mdash;hear me&mdash;I&mdash;I....&quot; Excessive emotion
overpowered her. In attempting to say more
she panted with distress.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it all about, Miss Prout? Calm yourself,
please&mdash;be quiet&quot;&mdash;he said it with some effort
to express both his resentment and his authority.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Osborne&mdash;I warn you&mdash;I cannot endure&mdash;any
rival&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who can&#39;t? you speak of a <i>rival</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Heaven, give me strength&mdash;words to explain.
Ah!...&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She had been standing with her left hand resting
on a table, shivering like a sail in the wind, and now
the hand suddenly gave way under her, and she sank
after it, falling to the ground in a faint, while her
head struck the edge of the table in her descent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, if this isn&#39;t the limit,&quot; muttered Osborne,
as he ran to her, calling loudly for Jenkins. He
lifted her to a sofa, and, in his flurry, not knowing
what else to do, wet her forehead with a little water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg&nbsp;200]</span>
from a carafe. Jenkins had not heard his call, and
by the time he looked round for a bell to summon
help, her eyes unclosed themselves, and she smiled
at him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are there....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You feel better now?&quot; He sat on a chair at
her head, looking down on her, wondering what inane
words he should use to extricate both himself and
her from an absurd position.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is all right.... I must have fainted. I
have undergone a great strain, a dreadful strain.
You should be sorry for me. Oh, I have loved&mdash;much.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Prout&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, don&#39;t call me that, or you kill me. You
should be sorry for me, if you have any pity, any
shred of humanity in your heart. I have&mdash;passed
through flames, and drunk of a cup of fire. Ten
women, yes, ten&mdash;have hungered and wailed in me.
I tell <i>you</i>&mdash;yet to whom should I tell it but to
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She smiled a ravished smile of pain; her hand fell
upon his heavily; her restless head swung from side
to side.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I am very sorry,&quot; said Osborne, forced to
gentleness in spite of the anger that had consumed
him earlier. &quot;It is impossible not to believe you
sincere. But, you will admit, all this is very singular
and unexpected. I am afraid now that I shall have
to send you on a trip to&mdash;Switzerland; or else go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
myself. Better you&mdash;it is chilling there, on the
glaciers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yet the attempt at humor died when he looked at
her face with its languishing, sick eyes, its expression
of swooning luxury. She sighed deeply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, you cannot escape me now, I think, or I
you,&quot; she murmured. &quot;There are powers too profound
to be run from when once at work, like the
suction of whirlpools. If you don&#39;t love me, my
love is a force enough for two, for a thousand. It
will draw and compel you. Yes, I think so. It
will either warm you, or burn you to ashes&mdash;and
myself, too. Oh, I swear to Heaven! It will, it
shall! You shouldn&#39;t have pressed my hand that
night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pressed your hand! on which night?&quot; asked Osborne,
who had now turned quite pale, and wanted
to run quickly out of the house but could not.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What, have you <i>forgotten</i>?&quot; she asked with
tender reproach, gazing into his eyes; &quot;the night
I was going to see my brother nine months ago, and
you went with me to Euston, and in saying good-by
you&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She suddenly covered her eyes with her fingers
in a rapture at the memory.</p>

<p class="indent">Osborne stared blankly at her. He recalled the
farewell at Euston, which was accidental, but he certainly
had no memory of having pressed her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I loved you before,&quot; her lips just whispered in
a pitiful assumption of confidence, &quot;but timidly, not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
admitting it to myself. With that pressure of your
hand, I was done with maidenhood, my soul rushed
to you. After that, you were mine, and I was
yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The words almost fainted on her bitten under lip,
and in Osborne, too, a rush of soul, or of blood, took
place, a little flush of his forehead. It was a bewitching
woman who lay there before him, with that
fair freckle-splashed face couched in its cloud of red
hair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come, now,&quot; he said, valiantly striving after the
commonplace, &quot;you are ill&mdash;you hardly know yet
what you are saying.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She half sat up suddenly, bending eagerly toward
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it pity? Is it &#39;yes&#39;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Please, please, let us forget that this has
ever&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It <i>would</i> be &#39;yes&#39; instantly but for that Tormouth
girl! Oh, drive her out of your mind! That
cannot be&mdash;I could never, never permit it! For that
reason alone&mdash;and besides, you are about to be arrested&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes: listen&mdash;I know more of what is going on
than you know. The man Furneaux, who, for his
own reasons, hates you, and is eager to injure you,
has even more proofs against you than you are aware
of. <i>I</i> happen to know that in his search of your
trunks he has discovered something or other which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg&nbsp;203]</span>
he considers conclusive against you. And there is
that housemaid at Feldisham Mansions, who screamed
out &#39;Mr. Osborne did it!&#39;&mdash;Furneaux only pretended
at the inquest that she was too ill to be present,
because he did not want to produce the whole
weight of his evidence just then. But he has her,
too, safe up his sleeve, and <i>she</i> is willing to swear
against you. And now he has got hold of your
Saracen dagger. But don&#39;t you fear <i>him</i>: I shall
know how to foil him at the last; I alone have knowledge
that will surely make him look a fool. Trust
in me! I tell you so. But I can&#39;t help your being
arrested&mdash;that must happen. Believe me, for I
know. And let that once take place, and that Tormouth
girl will never look at you again. I understand
her class, with its prides and prejudices&mdash;she
will never marry you&mdash;innocent or guilty&mdash;if you
have once stood in the dock at an assize court. Such
as she does not know what love is. <i>I</i> would take
you if you were a thousand times guilty&mdash;and I
only can prove you innocent&mdash;even if you were guilty&mdash;because
I am yours&mdash;your preordained wife&mdash;oh,
I shall die of my love&mdash;yes, kiss me&mdash;yes&mdash;now&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The torrent of words ended in a fierce fight for
breath. Her eyes were glaring like two lakes of
conflagration, her cheeks crimson, her forehead pale.
Unexpectedly, eagerly, she caught him round the
neck in an embrace from which there was no escape.
She drew him almost to his knees, and pressed his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span>
lips to hers with a passion that frightened and repelled
him.</p>

<p class="indent">And he was in the thick of this unhappy and ridiculous
experience when he heard behind him an
astonished &quot;Oh!&quot; from someone, while some other
person seemed to laugh in angry embarrassment.</p>

<p class="indent">It was Jenkins who had uttered the &quot;Oh!&quot; and
when the horrified Osborne glanced round he saw
Rosalind&#39;s eyes peering over Jenkins&#39;s shoulder. She
it was who had so lightly, so perplexedly, laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">Before he could free himself and spring up she
was gone. She had murmured to Jenkins: &quot;Some
other time,&quot; and fled.</p>

<p class="indent">As she ran out blindly, and was springing into
the cab, Janoc, in pursuit of her, drove up. In an
instant he was looking in through the door of the
cab.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Marsh?&quot; he inquired.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His hands met, wringing in distress.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are the lady I am searching for, the mistress
of the young girl Pauline Dessaulx, is it not? I am
her brother. You see&mdash;you can see&mdash;the resemblance
in our faces. She threatens this instant to
commit the suicide&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rosalind was forced to forget her own sufferings
in this new terror.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pauline!&quot; she cried, &quot;I am not her employer.
Moreover, she is ill&mdash;in bed&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She has escaped to my lodging during your absence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
from home! Something dreadful has happened
to her&mdash;she speaks of the loss of some weapon&mdash;one
cannot understand her ravings! And unless
she sees you&mdash;her hands cannot be kept from destroying
herself&mdash;Oh, lady! lady! Come to my sweet
sister&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rosalind looked at him with the scared eyes of one
who hears, yet not understands. There was a mad
probability in all this, since Pauline <i>might</i> have discovered
the loss of the daggers; and, in her present
anguish of spirit, the thought that the man&#39;s story
might only be a device to lure her into some trap
never entered Rosalind&#39;s head. Indeed, in her weariness
of everything, she regarded the mission of succor
as a relief.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where do you live? I will go with you,&quot; she
said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lady! Lady! Thank God!&quot; he exclaimed.
&quot;It is not far from here, in Soho.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must come in my cab,&quot; said Rosalind.</p>

<p class="indent">Janoc ran to pay his own cabman, came back instantly,
and they started eastward, just as Osborne,
with the wild face of a man falling down a precipice,
rushed to his door, calling after them frantically:
&quot;Hi, there! Stop! Stop! For Heaven&#39;s sake&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But the cab went on its way.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br/>
THE SARACEN DAGGER</h2>

<p class="indent">Next morning, just as the clock was striking
eight, Osborne was rising from his bed after a night
of unrest when Jenkins rapped at the door and came
in, deferential and calm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Marsh below to see you, sir,&quot; he announced.</p>

<p class="indent">Osborne blinked and stared with the air of a man
not thoroughly awake, though it was his mind, not
his body, that was torpid.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs.,&quot; he said, &quot;not Miss?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, sir, Mrs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll be there in five minutes,&quot; he hissed with a
fierce arousing of his faculties, and never before had
he flung on his clothes in such a flurry of haste;
in less than five minutes he was flying down the stairs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Forgive me!&quot; broke from his lips, as he entered
the drawing-room, and &quot;Forgive me!&quot; his visitor
was saying to him in the same instant.</p>

<p class="indent">It was pitiful to see her&mdash;she, ever so enthroned in
serenity, from whom such a thing as agitation had
seemed so remote, was wildly agitated now. That
pathetic pallor of the aged when their heart is in
labor now underlay her skin. Her lips, her fingers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg&nbsp;207]</span>
trembled; the tip of her nose, showing under her
half-raised veil, was pinched.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The early hour&mdash;it is so distressing&mdash;I beg your
forgiveness&mdash;I am in most dreadful trouble&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Please sit down,&quot; he said, touching her hand,
&quot;and let me get you some breakfast.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, nothing&mdash;I couldn&#39;t eat&mdash;it is Rosalind&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Now he, too, went a shade paler.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What of Rosalind?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you by chance know anything of her whereabouts?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She has disappeared.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her head bowed, and a sob broke from her bosom.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Disappeared&quot;&mdash;his lips breathed the word foolishly
after her, while he looked at her almost stupidly.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Marsh&#39;s hand dropped with a little nervous
fling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She has not been at home all night. She left
the house apparently between four and five yesterday&mdash;I
was out; then I came in; then you called....
She has not come home&mdash;it is impossible to conceive....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, she has slept with some friend,&quot; he said,
feeling that the world reeled around him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, she has never done that without letting me
know.... She would surely have telegraphed me....
It is quite impossible even to imagine what
dispensation of God&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>
She stopped, her lips working; suddenly covering
her eyes with her hand, as another sob gushed from
her, she humbly muttered:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Forgive me. I am nearly out of my senses.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He sprang up, touched a bell, and whispered to
Jenkins, who instantly was with him: &quot;Brandy&mdash;<i>quick</i>.&quot;
Then, running to kneel at the old lady&#39;s
chair, he touched her left hand, saying: &quot;Take heart&mdash;trust
in God&#39;s Providence&mdash;rely upon <i>me</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You believe, then, that you may find her&mdash;&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Surely: whatever else I may fail in, I could not
fail now.... Just one sip of this to oblige me.&quot;
Jenkins had stolen in, and she drank a little out of
the glass that Osborne offered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must think it odd,&quot; she said, &quot;that I come
to you. I could not give a reason&mdash;but I was so
distracted and benumbed. I thought of you, and
felt impelled&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You were right,&quot; he said. &quot;I am the proper
person to appeal to in this case. Besides, she was
here yesterday&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rosalind?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The fact is&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, she was here? Well, that is something discovered!
I did well to come. Yes&mdash;you were saying&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will tell you everything. Three days ago she
wrote me a letter&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rosalind?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you astonished?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span>
&quot;I understood&mdash;I thought&mdash;that your friendship
with her had suffered some&mdash;check.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is so,&quot; said Osborne with a bent head.
&quot;You may remember the night of the dance at the
Abbey down at Tormouth. That night, when I
was full of hopes of her favor, she suddenly cast
me off like a burr from her robe&mdash;I am not even
now sure why&mdash;unless she had discovered that my
name was not Glyn.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If so, she no doubt considered that a sufficient
reason, Mr. Osborne,&quot; said Mrs. Marsh, a chill in
her tone. &quot;One does not like the names of one&#39;s
friends to be detachable labels.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t think that I blame her one bit!&quot; cried
Osborne&mdash;&quot;no more than I blame myself. I was
ordered by&mdash;the police to take a name. There
seemed to be good reason for it. I only blame my
baleful fate. Anyway, so it was. She dropped me&mdash;into
the Pit. But she was at the inquest&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed? At the inquest. She was there.
Singular.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Deeply veiled. She didn&#39;t think, I suppose, that
I should know. But I should feel her presence in
the blackest&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Osborne&mdash;I must beg&mdash;do not make your
declarations to <i>me</i>&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;May I not? Be good&mdash;be pitiful. Here am I,
charged with guilt, conscious of innocence&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let us suppose all that, but are you a man free
to make declarations of love? One would say that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
you are, as it were, married for some time to come
to the lady who has lately been buried.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;True,&quot; said Osborne&mdash;&quot;in the eyes of the world,
in a formal way: but in the eyes of those near to
me? Oh, I appeal to your indulgence, your friendship,
your heart. Tell me that you forgive, that
you understand me! and then I shall be so exuberantly
gladsome that in the sweep of my exhilaration
I shall go straight and find her, wherever
she lies hidden.... Will you not say &#39;yes&#39; on
those terms?&quot; He smiled wanly, with a hungry
cajolery, looking into her face.</p>

<p class="indent">But she did not unbend.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let us first find her! and then other things may
be discussed. But to find her! it is past all knowing&mdash;Oh,
deep is the trouble of my soul to-day, Mr.
Osborne!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wait&mdash;hope&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you were speaking of yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. She was at the inquest: and when I saw
her&mdash;think how I felt! I said: &#39;She believes in
me.&#39; And three days after that she wrote to
me&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My poor Rosalind!&quot; murmured Mrs. Marsh.
&quot;She suffered more than I imagined. Her nature
is more recondite than the well in which Truth dwells.
What <i>could</i> she have written to you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That I don&#39;t know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How&mdash;&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As I was about to open the letter, a telegram
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg&nbsp;211]</span>
came from her. &#39;Don&#39;t read my letter: I will call
for it unopened in person,&#39; it said. Picture my agony
then! And now I am going to tell you something
that will move you to compassion for me, if you
never had it before. Yesterday she called for the
letter. I was with you at Porchester Gardens at that
very hour. When I came home, an extraordinary
scene awaited me with my secretary, a Miss
Prout.... I tell you this as to a friend, a
Mother, who will believe even the incredible. An
extraordinary scene.... Without the least warning,
the least encouragement that I know of, Miss
Prout declared herself in love with me. While I stood
astonished, she fainted. I bore her to a sofa. Soon
after she opened her eyes, she&mdash;drew&mdash;me to her&mdash;no,
I will say that I was <i>not</i> to blame; and I was in
that situation, when the library door opened, and who
should be there looking at me but&mdash;yes&mdash;<i>she</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Marsh&#39;s eyes fell. There was a little pressure
of the lips that revealed scant sympathy with
compromising situations. And suddenly a thought
turned her skin to a ghastlier white. What if the
sight of that scene accounted for Rosalind&#39;s disappearance?
If Rosalind was dead&mdash;by her own
act? The old lady had often to admit that she did
not know the deepest deeps of her daughter&#39;s character.
But she banished the half-thought hurriedly,
contenting herself with saying aloud:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That made the second time she came to you
yesterday. Why a second time?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg&nbsp;212]</span>
&quot;I have no idea!&quot; was the dismayed reply. &quot;She
uttered not one word&mdash;just turned away, and hurried
out to her waiting cab&mdash;and by the time I could
wring myself free, and run after her, the cab was
going off. I shouted&mdash;I ran at top speed&mdash;she
would not stop. I think a man was in the cab with
her&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A man, you say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think so. I just caught a glimpse of a face
that looked out sideways&mdash;a dark man he seemed to
me&mdash;I&#39;m not sure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It becomes more and more mysterious!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, we must be making a move to do something&mdash;first,
have you breakfasted?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She had eaten nothing! Osborne persuaded her
to join him in a hurried meal, during which his
motor-car arrived, and soon they set off together.
He was for going straight to the police, but she
shrank from the notoriety of that final exposure
until she had the clear assurance that it was absolutely
necessary. So they drove from friend to
friend of the Marshes who might possibly have some
information; then drove home to Mrs. Prawser&#39;s to
see if there was news. Osborne had luncheon there&mdash;a
polite pretense at eating, since they were too
full of wonder and woe to care for food. By this
time Mrs. Marsh had unbent somewhat to Osborne,
and humbly enough had said to him, &quot;Oh, find her,
and if she is alive, every other consideration shall
weigh less than my boundless gratitude to you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg&nbsp;213]</span>
After the luncheon they again drove about London,
making inquiries without hope wherever the
least chance of a clew lay; and finally, near six, they
went to Scotland Yard.</p>

<p class="indent">To Inspector Winter in his office the whole tale
was told; and, after sitting at his desk in a long
silence, frowning upon the story, he said at last:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, there is, of course, a great deal more in
this than meets the eye.&quot; He spun round to Mrs.
Marsh: &quot;Has your daughter undergone anything to
upset her at home lately?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing,&quot; was the answer. &quot;One of the
servants in the house has had a sort of hysteria:
but that did not trouble Rosalind beyond the mere
exercise of womanly sympathy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Any visitors? Any odd circumstance in that
way?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No unusual visitors&mdash;except an Inspector Furneaux,
who&mdash;twice, I think&mdash;had interviews with her.
She was not very explicit in telling me the subject
of them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Inspector Furneaux,&quot; muttered Winter. To
himself he said: &quot;I thought somehow that this thing
was connected with Feldisham Mansions.&quot; And at
once now, with a little start, he asked: &quot;What, by
the way, is the name of the servant who has had the
hysteria?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Her name is Pauline,&quot; answered Mrs. Marsh&mdash;&quot;a French girl.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, Pauline!&quot; said Winter&mdash;&quot;just so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg&nbsp;214]</span>
The fewness of his words gave proof of the activity
of his brain. He knew how Clarke had obtained
the diary of Rose de Bercy from Pauline, and he
felt that Pauline was in some undetermined way connected
with the murder. He knew, too, that she
was now to be found somewhere in Porchester Gardens,
and had intended looking her up for general
inquiries before two days had passed. That Pauline
might actually have had a hand in the crime had
never entered into his speculations&mdash;he was far too
hot in these days on the trail of Furneaux, who
was being constantly watched by his instructions.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think I will see this Pauline to-night,&quot; he said.
&quot;Meantime, I can only recommend you to hope, Mrs.
Marsh. These things generally have some simple
explanation in the end, and turn out less black than
they look. Expect me, then, at your residence within
an hour.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But when Mrs. Marsh and Osborne were gone he
was perplexed, remembering that this was Thursday
evening, for he had promised himself on this very
evening to be at a spot which he had been told by
one of his men that Furneaux had visited on two
previous Thursday evenings, a spot where he would
see a sight that would interest him.</p>

<p class="indent">While he was on the horns of the dilemma as to
going there, or going to Pauline, Inspector Clarke
entered: and at once Winter shelved upon Clarke
the business of sounding Pauline.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg&nbsp;215]</span>
&quot;You seem to have a lot of power over her&mdash;to
make her give up the diary so promptly,&quot; he said
to Clarke. &quot;Go to her, then, get at the bottom
of this business, and see if you cannot hit upon some
connection between the disappearance of Miss Marsh
and the murder of the actress.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Clarke stood up with alacrity, and started off.
Presently Winter himself was in a cab, making for
the Brompton Cemetery.</p>

<p class="indent">As for Clarke, the instant he was within sight of
Porchester Gardens, his whole interest turned from
Pauline Dessaulx and the vanished Rosalind to two
men whom he saw in the street almost opposite the
house in which Pauline lay. They were Janoc and
the Italian, Antonio, and Antonio seemed to be reasoning
and pleading with Janoc, who had the gestures
of a man distracted.</p>

<p class="indent">Hanging about near them was a third man, whom
Clarke hardly noticed&mdash;a loafer in a long coat of
rags, a hat without any crown, and visible toes&mdash;a
diminutive loafer&mdash;Furneaux, in fact, who, for his
own reasons, was also interested in Janoc in these
days.</p>

<p class="indent">Every now and again Janoc looked up at the
windows of Mrs. Marsh&#39;s residence with frantic
gestures, and a crying face&mdash;a thing which greatly
struck Clarke; and anon the loafer passed by Janoc
and Antonio, unobserved, peering into the gutter for
the cast-aside ends of cigars and cigarettes.</p>

<p class="indent">Instantly Clarke stole down the opposite side of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg&nbsp;216]</span>
the square into which the house faced, looked about
him, saw no one, climbed some railings, and then
through the bushes stole near to the pavement where
the foreigners stood. There, concealed in the shrubbery,
he could clearly hear Janoc say:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Am I never to see her? My little one! But
I am about to see her! I will knock at that door,
and clasp her in my arms.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My friend, be reasonable!&quot; pleaded Antonio,
holding the arm of Janoc, who made more show of
tearing himself free than he made real effort&mdash;with
that melodramatic excess of gesture to which the
Latin races are prone. &quot;Be reasonable! Oh, she
is wiser than you! She has hidden herself from you
because she realizes the danger of being seen near
you even in the dark. Be sure that she has longed
to see you as keenly as you hunger to see her; but
she feels that there must be no meeting with so many
spying eyes in the world&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let them spy! but they shall not keep me from
the embrace of one whom I love, of one who has
suffered,&quot; said Janoc, covering his face. &quot;Oh, when
I think of your cruelty&mdash;you who all the time knew
where she was and did not tell me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I confess it, but I acted for the best,&quot; said Antonio.
&quot;She wrote to me three days after the
murder, so that she might have news of you. I met
her, and received from her that bit of lace from the
actress&#39;s dress which I put into Osborne&#39;s bag at
Tormouth, to throw still more doubt upon him. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg&nbsp;217]</span>
she implored me not to reveal to you where she was,
lest, if you should be seen with her, suspicion of the
murder should fall upon you&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Her heart&#39;s goodness! My sister! My little
one!&quot; exclaimed Janoc.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only be patient!&quot; wooed Antonio&mdash;&quot;do not
go to her. Soon she will make her escape to France,
and you also, and then you will embrace the one
the other. And now you have no longer cause for
much anxiety as to her capture, for the dagger cannot
be found with her, since it lies safe in your room
in your own keeping, and to-night you will drop it
into the river, where it will be buried forever. Do
not go to her&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">These were the last words of the dialogue that
Clarke heard, for the tidings that &quot;the dagger&quot;
was in Janoc&#39;s room sent him creeping away through
the bushes. He was soon over the railings and in
a cab, making for Soho; and behind him in another
cab went Furneaux, whose driver, looking at his
fare&#39;s attire, had said, &quot;Pay first, and then I&#39;ll take
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Clarke, for his part, had no difficulty in entering
Janoc&#39;s room with his skeleton-keys&mdash;indeed, he had
been there before! Nor was there any difficulty in
finding the dagger. There it lay, with another, in
the narrow cardboard box into which Rosalind had
put both weapons on finding them behind the shelf
of books in Pauline&#39;s room.</p>

<p class="indent">Clarke&#39;s eyes, as they fell at last upon that Saracen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg&nbsp;218]</span>
blade which he knew so well without ever having
seen it, pored, gloated over it, with a glitter in
them.</p>

<p class="indent">He relocked the trunk, relocked the door, and with
the box held fast, ran down the three stairs to his
cab&mdash;feeling himself a made man, a head taller than
all Scotland Yard that night. He put his precious
find on the interior front seat of the cab&mdash;a four-wheeler;
for in his eagerness he had jumped into the
first wheeled thing that he had seen, and, having
lodged the box inside, being anxious to hide it, he
made a step forward toward the driver, to tell him
whither he had now to drive. Then he entered,
shut the door, and, as the vehicle drove off, put out
his hand to the box to feast his eyes on its contents
again. But the box was gone&mdash;no daggers were
there!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stop!&quot; howled Clarke.</p>

<p class="indent">The cab stopped, but it was all in vain. The
loafer, who had opened the other door of the cab
with swift deftness while Clarke spoke to the driver,
had long since turned a near corner with box and
daggers, and was well away. Clarke, standing in
the street, glanced up at the sky, down at the ground,
and stared round about, like a man who does not
know in which world he finds himself.</p>

<p class="indent">Meantime, Furneaux hailed another cab, again
having to pay in advance, and started off on the drive
to Brompton Cemetery&mdash;where Winter was already
in hiding, awaiting his arrival.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[pg&nbsp;219]</span>
Something like a storm of wind was tearing the
night to pieces, and the trees of the place of graves
gesticulated as if they were wrangling. The moon
had moved up, all involved in heavy clouds whose
grotesque shapes her glare struck into garish contrasts
of black against silver. Furneaux bent his
way against the gale, holding on his dilapidated
hat, his rags fluttering fantastically behind him, till
he came to the one grave he sought&mdash;the cheerless
resting-place of Rose de Bercy. The very spirit of
gloom and loneliness brooded here, in a nook almost
inclosed with foliage. As yet no stone had been
erected. The grave was just a narrow oblong of
red marl and turf, which the driven rain now
made soft and yielding. On it lay two withered
wreaths.</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux, standing by it, took off his hat, and
the rain flecked his hair. Then from a breast-pocket
of his rags he took out a little funnel of
paper, out of which he cast some Parma violets upon
the mound. This was Thursday&mdash;and Rose de
Bercy had been murdered on a Thursday.</p>
<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 488px;">

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">Then from a breast-pocket he took a little funnel of paper</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Page 219</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">After that he stood there perhaps twenty minutes,
his head bent in meditation.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he peered cautiously into the dark about him,
took a penknife with a good-sized blade from a
pocket, and with it set to work to make a grave
within the grave&mdash;a grave just big and deep enough
to contain the box with the daggers. He buried his
singular tribute and covered it over.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg&nbsp;220]</span>
After this he waited silently, apparently lost in
thought, for some ten minutes more.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, with that curious omniscience which sometimes
seemed to belong to the man, he sent a strange
cry into the gloom.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you anywhere about, Winter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Nor was there anything aggressive in the call.
It was subdued, sad, touched with solemnity, like the
voice of a man who had wept, and dried his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">There was little delay before Winter appeared
out of the shadow of his ambush.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am!&quot; he said; he was amazed beyond expression,
yet his colleague had ever been incomprehensible
in some things.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Windy night,&quot; said Furneaux, in an absurd affectation
of ease.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And wet,&quot; said Winter, utterly at a loss how to
take the other.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Odd that we should both come to visit the poor
thing&#39;s grave at the same hour,&quot; remarked Furneaux.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It <i>may</i> be odd,&quot; agreed Winter.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a bitter silence.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Furneaux&#39;s cold voice was heard again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I dare say, now, it seems to you a suspicious thing
that I should come to this grave at all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why should it, Furneaux?&quot; asked his chief
bluntly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, why?&quot; said Furneaux. &quot;I once knew her.
I told you from the first that I knew her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I remember: you did.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>
&quot;You asked no questions as to how I came to
know her, or how long, or under what circumstances.
Why did you not ask? Such questions occur among
friends: and I&mdash;might have told you. But you did
not ask.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Winter, I&#39;d see you hanged first!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The words came in a sharp rasp&mdash;his first sign of
anger.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hanged?&quot; repeated Winter, flushing. &quot;You&#39;ll
see <i>me</i> hanged? <i>I</i> usually see the hanging, Furneaux!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sometimes you do: sometimes you are not half
smart enough!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux barked the taunt like a dog at him.</p>

<p class="indent">Of the two, the big bluff man of Anglo-Saxon
breed, mystified and saddened though he was, showed
more self-control than the excitable little man more
French than English.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is an occasion when I leave the smartness
to you, Furneaux,&quot; he said bitterly, &quot;though there
is a sort of clever duplicity which ought to be
drained out of the blood, even if it cost a limb, or
a life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, you prove yourself a trusty friend&mdash;loyal to
the backbone!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For Heaven&#39;s sake, make no appeal to our friendship!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What! Appeal? I? Oh, this is too much!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are trying me beyond endurance. Can&#39;t
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg&nbsp;222]</span>
you understand? Why keep up this farce of pretense?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was genuine emotion in Winter&#39;s voice, but
Furneaux&#39;s harsh laugh mingled with the soughing
of the laden branches that tossed in the wind.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Farce, indeed!&quot; he cried. &quot;I refuse to continue
it. Go, then, and be punished&mdash;you deserve
it&mdash;you, whom I trusted more than a brother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He turned on his heel, and made off, a weird figure
in those wind-blown tatters, and Winter watched him
with eyes that had in them some element of fear,
almost of hope, for in that hour he could have forgiven
Furneaux were he standing by his corpse.</p>

<p class="indent">But the instinct of duty soon came uppermost.
He had seen his colleague bury something in the
grave, and the briefest search brought to light the
daggers in their cardboard coffin. Even in that
overwhelming gloom of night and shivering yews he
recognized one of the weapons. A groan broke from
him, as it were, in protest.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mad!&quot; he sighed, &quot;stark, staring mad&mdash;to
leave this here, where he knew I must find it. My
poor Furneaux! Perhaps that is best. I must
defer action for a few hours, if only to give him a
last chance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">While the Chief Inspector was stumbling to the
gate of the Cemetery&mdash;which was long since closed
to all except those who could show an official permit&mdash;one
of his subordinates was viewing the Feldisham
Mansions crime in a far different light. Inspector
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg&nbsp;223]</span>
Clarke, in whom elation at his discovery was chastened
by chagrin at his loss, was walking towards
Scotland Yard and saying to himself:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can prove, anyhow, that I took the rotten
things from his trunk. So now, Monsieur Janoc,
the next and main item is to arrest you!&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg&nbsp;224]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br/>
OSBORNE MAKES A VOW</h2>

<p class="indent">When Inspector Winter returned to his office from
the cemetery he sat at his desk, gazing at the two
daggers before him, and awaiting the coming of
Clarke, from whom he expected to receive a full report
of an interview with Pauline Dessaulx in connection
with the disappearance of Rosalind.</p>

<p class="indent">There lay that long sought-for Saracen dagger
at last: and Furneaux had it, had been caught burying
it in the grave of her who had been killed by it.
Was not this fact, added to the fact that Furneaux
was seen in Osborne&#39;s museum before the murder&mdash;was
it not enough to justify&mdash;indeed, enough to demand&mdash;Furneaux&#39;s
arrest straight away? And
Furneaux had visited Rose de Bercy that night&mdash;had
been seen by Bertha Seward, the actress&#39;s cook!
And yet Winter hesitated.... What had been
Furneaux&#39;s motive? There was as yet no ray of
light as to that, though Winter had caused elaborate
inquiries to be made in Jersey as to Furneaux&#39;s
earlier career there. And there were <i>two</i> daggers
buried, not one....</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg&nbsp;225]</span>
&quot;Where does <i>this</i> come in, this <i>second</i> dagger...?&quot;
wondered Winter, a maze of doubt and
horror clouding his brain.</p>

<p class="indent">Just then Clarke arrived, rather breathless, jubilant,
excited, but Winter had already hidden the daggers
instinctively&mdash;throwing them into a drawer of
his writing-desk.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, what news of Miss Marsh?&quot; he asked,
with a semblance of official calm he was far from
feeling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The fact is, sir, I haven&#39;t been to Pauline
Des&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was nearly at her door when I came across
Gaston Janoc&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Heavens!&quot; muttered Winter in despair.
&quot;You and your eternal Janocs&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The smiling Clarke looked at his chief in full confidence
that he would not be reprimanded for having
disobeyed orders. Suddenly making three steps on
tiptoe, he said in Winter&#39;s ear:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t be too startled&mdash;here&#39;s an amazing piece
of information for you, sir&mdash;<i>it was Gaston Janoc</i>
who committed the Feldisham Mansions murder!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter stared at him without real comprehension.
&quot;Gaston Janoc!&quot; his lips repeated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want to apply to-morrow for a warrant for
his arrest,&quot; crowed Clarke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, man alive!&mdash;don&#39;t drive me distracted,&quot;
cried out Winter; &quot;what are you talking about?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg&nbsp;226]</span>
&quot;Oh, I am not acting on any impulse,&quot; said
Clarke, placidly satisfied, enthroned on facts; &quot;I
may tell you now that I have been working on the Feldisham
Mansions affair from the first on my own
account. I couldn&#39;t help it. I was drawn to it
as a needle by a magnet, and I now have all the
threads&mdash;ten distinct proofs&mdash;in my hands. It
was Gaston Janoc did it! Just listen to this,
sir&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, do as you like about your wretched Anarchist,
Clarke,&quot; said Winter pestered, waving him
away; &quot;I can&#39;t stop now. I sent you to do something,
and you should have done it. Miss Marsh&#39;s
mother is half dead with fright and grief; the thing
is pressing, and I&#39;ll go myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With a snatch at his hat, he rushed out, Clarke
following sullenly to go home, though on his way
northward, by sheer force of habit, he strolled
through Soho, looked up at Janoc&#39;s windows, and
presently, catching sight of Janoc himself coming
out of the restaurant on the ground floor, nodded
after him, muttering to himself: &quot;Soon now&mdash;&mdash;&quot;
and went off.</p>

<p class="indent">But had he shadowed his Janoc just then, it might
have been well! The Frenchman first went into a
French shop labeled &quot;Vins et Comestibles,&quot; where he
bought slices of sausage and a bottle of cheap wine,
from which he got the cork drawn&mdash;he already carried
half a loaf of bread wrapped in paper, and with
bread, sausage, and wine, bent his way through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg&nbsp;227]</span>
spitting rain and high wind, his coat collar
turned up round his neck, to a house in Poland
Street.</p>

<p class="indent">An unoccupied house: its window-glass thicker
than itself with grime, broken in some of the panes,
while in others were roughly daubed the words: &quot;To
Let.&quot; But he possessed a key, went in, picked up
a candlestick in the passage, and lit the candle-end
it contained.</p>

<p class="indent">At the end of the passage he went down a narrow
staircase of wood, then down some stone steps, to
the door of a back cellar: and this, too, he opened
with a key.</p>

<p class="indent">Rosalind was crouching on the floor in the corner
farthest from the door, her head bent down, her feet
tucked under her skirt. She had been asleep: for
the air in there was very heavy, the cellar hardly
twelve feet square, no windows, and the slightest
movement roused a cloud of dust. The walls were
of rough stone, without break or feature, save three
little vaulted caves like ovens in the wall facing the
door, made to contain wine bottles and small barrels:
in fact, one barrel and several empty bottles now lay
about in the dust. Besides, there were sardine tins
and a tin of mortadel, and relics of sausage and
bread, with which Janoc had lately supplied his prisoner,
with a bottle half full of wine, and one of
water: all showing very dimly in the feeble rays of
the candle.</p>

<p class="indent">She looked at him, without moving, just raising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg&nbsp;228]</span>
her scornful eyes and no more, and he, holding up
the light, looked at her a good time.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lady,&quot; he said at last, &quot;I have brought you
some meat, wine, and bread.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She made no answer. He stepped forward, and
laid them by her side; then walked back to the door,
as if to go out, coughing at the dust; but stopped
and leant his back on the wall near the door, his
legs crossed, looking down at her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lady,&quot; he said presently, &quot;you still remain fixed
in your obstinacy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">No answer: only her wide-open reproving eyes
dwelt on him with their steady accusation like a conscience,
and her hand stuck and stuck many times
with a hat-pin her hat which lay on her lap. Her
gown appeared to be very frowsy and unkempt now;
her hair was untidy, and quite gray with dust on
one side, her face was begrimed and stained with
the tracks of tears; but her lips were firm, and the
wonderful eyes, chiding, disdainful, gave no sign of
a drooping spirit.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will say nothing to me?&quot; asked Janoc.</p>

<p class="indent">No answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it that you think I may relent and let you
free, lady, because my heart weakens at your suffering?
Do not imagine such a thing of me! The
more you are beautiful, the more you are sublime in
your torture, the more I adore you, the more my
heart pours out tears of blood for you, the more
I am inflexible in my will. You do not know me&mdash;I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg&nbsp;229]</span>
am a man, I am not a wind; a mind, not an emotion.
Oh, pity is strong in me, love is strong; but
what is strongest of all is self-admiration, my worship
of intelligence. And have I not made it impossible
that you should be let free without conditions
by my confession to you that it was my sister
Pauline who killed the actress? I tell you again it
was Pauline who killed her. It was not a murder!
It was an assassination&mdash;a political assassination.
Mademoiselle de Bercy had proved a traitress to the
group of Internationals to which she belonged: she
was condemned to death; the lot fell upon Pauline
to execute the sentence; and on the day appointed
she executed it, having first stolen from Mr. Osborne
the &#39;celt&#39; and the dagger, so as to cast the suspicion
upon him. I tell you this of my sister&mdash;of one
who to me is dearest on earth; and, having told you
all this, is it any longer possible that I should set
you free without conditions? You see, do you not,
that it is impossible?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">No answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I only ask you to promise&mdash;to give your simple
word&mdash;not to say, or hint, to anyone that Pauline
had the daggers. What a risk I take! What trust
in you! I do not know you&mdash;I but trust blindly
in the highly-evolved, that divine countenance which
is yours; and since it was with the object of saving
my sister that you came here with me, my gratitude
to you deepens my trust. Give me, then, this promise,
Miss Marsh!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg&nbsp;230]</span>
Now her lips opened a little to form the word
&quot;No,&quot; which he could just catch.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sublime!&quot; he cried&mdash;&quot;and I am no less sublime.
If I was rich, if I had a fair name, and if I could
dare to hope to win the love of a lady such as you,
how favored of the gods I should be! But that is&mdash;a
dream. Here, then, you will remain, until the
day that Pauline is safely hidden in France: and on
that day&mdash;since for myself I care little&mdash;I will open
this door to you: never before. Meanwhile, tell me
if you think of anything more that I can do for your
comfort.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">No answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-night.&quot; He turned to go.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You made me a promise,&quot; she said at the last
moment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have kept it,&quot; he said. &quot;This afternoon, at
great risk to myself, I wrote to your mother the
words: &#39;Your daughter is alive and safe.&#39; Are you
satisfied?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-night,&quot; he murmured again.</p>

<p class="indent">Having locked the door, he waited five minutes outside
silently, to hear if she sobbed or wailed in there
in the utter dark: but no sound came to him. He
went upstairs, put out the light, put down the candlestick
in the passage, and was just drawing back
the door latch, when he was aware of a strong step
marching quickly along an almost deserted pavement.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg&nbsp;231]</span>
After a little he peeped out and recognized the
heavy figure of Inspector Winter. Even Janoc, the
dreamer, whose dreams took such tragic shape, was
surprised for an instant.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How limited is the consciousness of men!&quot; he
muttered. &quot;That so-called clever detective little
guesses what he has just passed by.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Winter, too, might have indulged in the same
reflection: &quot;How limited the consciousness of Janoc!
He doesn&#39;t know where I am passing to&mdash;to visit
and question his sister Pauline!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter, a little further on, took a taxicab to Porchester
Gardens, got out at the bottom of the street,
and was walking on to Mrs. Marsh&#39;s temporary residence,
when he saw Furneaux coming the opposite
way.</p>

<p class="indent">Winter wished to pretend not to see him, but Furneaux
spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Providence throws us together somehow!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! Why blame Providence?&quot; said Winter,
with rather a snarl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not two hours ago there was our chance meeting
by that graveside&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The &quot;chance&quot; irritated Winter to the quick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have all the faults of the French nature,&quot;
he said bitterly, &quot;without any of its merits: its levity
without its industry, its pettiness without its minuteness&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you the English frankness without its honesty.
The chief thing about a Frenchman is his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg&nbsp;232]</span>
intelligence. At least you do not deny that I am
intelligent?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have thought you intelligent. I am damned
if I think you so any longer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you will again&mdash;soon&mdash;when I wish it. We
met just now at a grave, and there was more buried
in that grave than the grave-diggers know: and we
both stood looking at it: but I fancy there were more
X-rays in my eye to see what was buried there than
in yours!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Driven beyond the bounds of patience, Winter
threw out an arm in angry protest.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ha! ha! ha!&quot; tittered Furneaux.</p>

<p class="indent">An important official at Scotland Yard must learn
early the value of self-control. Consumed with a
certain sense of the monstrous in this display of untimely
mirth, Winter only gnawed a bristle or two
of his mustache. He looked strangely at Furneaux,
and they lingered together, loath to part, having
still something bitter and rankling to say, but not
knowing quite what, since men who have been all in
all to each other cannot quarrel without some childish
tone of schoolboy spite mingling in the wrangle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I believe I know where you are going now!&quot;
jeered Furneaux.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, you were always good at guessing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Going to pump the Pauline girl about Miss
Marsh.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;True, of course, but not a very profound analysis
considering that I am just ten yards from the house.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg&nbsp;233]</span>
&quot;Don&#39;t you even know where Miss Rosalind Marsh
is?&quot; asked Furneaux, producing a broken cigar from
a pocket and sniffing it, simply because he was well
aware that the trick displeased his superior.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. Do you?&quot; Winter jeered back at him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, the sheerest bluff!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no bluff. I know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, let me imagine that it is bluff, anyway:
for brute as a man might be, I won&#39;t give you credit
for being <i>such</i> a brute as to keep that poor old lady
undergoing the torments of hell through a deliberate
silence of yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Didn&#39;t you say that I have all the bad qualities
of the Latin temperament?&quot; answered Furneaux.
&quot;Now, there is something cat-like in the Latin; a
Spaniard, for example, can be infernally cruel at a
bullfight; and I&#39;ll admit that <i>I</i> can, too. But &#39;torments
of hell&#39; is rather an exaggeration, nor will
the &#39;torments&#39; last mortally long, for to-morrow
afternoon at about four&mdash;at the hour that I choose&mdash;in
the hour that I am ready&mdash;Miss Marsh will
drive up to that door there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Evidently you were not born in Jersey, but in
Gascony,&quot; Winter said sourly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wrong again! A Jersey man will bounce any
Gascon off his feet,&quot; said Furneaux. &quot;And, just to
pile up the agony, here is another sample for you,
since you accuse me of bluffing. To-morrow afternoon,
at that same hour&mdash;about four&mdash;I shall have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[pg&nbsp;234]</span>
that scoundrel Osborne in custody charged with the
murder in Feldisham Mansions.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Osborne?&quot; whispered Winter, towering and
frowning above his diminutive adversary. &quot;Oh,
Furneaux, you drive me to despair by your folly.
If you are mad, which I hope you are, that explains,
I suppose, your delusion that others are mad, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Genius is closely allied with insanity,&quot; said Furneaux
carelessly; &quot;yet, you observe that I have never
hinted any doubt as to your saneness. Wait, you&#39;ll
see: my case against Osborne is now complete. A
warrant can&#39;t be refused, not even by you, and to-morrow,
as sure as you stand there, I lay my hand
on your protégé&#39;s shoulder.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter nearly choked in his rage.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right! We&#39;ll see about that!&quot; he said with
a furious nod of menace. Furneaux chuckled; and
now by a simultaneous impulse they walked apart,
Furneaux whistling, in Winter a whirlwind of passion
blowing the last shreds of pity from his soul.</p>

<p class="indent">He was soon sitting at the bedside of Pauline Dessaulx,
now convalescent, though the coming of this
strange man threw her afresh into a tumult of agitation.
But Winter comforted her, smoothed her
hand, assured her that there was no cause for alarm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know that you took Mademoiselle de Bercy&#39;s
diary,&quot; he said to her, &quot;and it was very wrong of
you not to give it up to the police, and to hide yourself
as you did when your evidence was wanted. But,
don&#39;t be frightened&mdash;I am here to-night to see if you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg&nbsp;235]</span>
can throw any light on the sad disappearance of Miss
Marsh. The suspense is killing her mother, and I
feel sure that it has some connection with the Feldisham
Mansions affair. Now, can you help me?
Think&mdash;tell me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I cannot!&quot; She wrung her hands in a
paroxysm of distress&mdash;&quot;If I could, I would. I cannot
imagine&mdash;&mdash;!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, then, that part of my inquiry is ended.
Only, listen to this attentively. I want to ask you
one other question: Why did you leave the Exhibition
early on the night of the murder, and where did you
go to?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>I&mdash;I&mdash;I</i>, sir!&quot; she said, pointing to her guiltless
breast with a gaping mouth; &quot;I, poor me, I
<i>left</i>&mdash;&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, come now, don&#39;t delude yourself that the
police are fools. You went to the Exhibition with
the cook, Hester Se&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And she has said such a thing of me? She has
declared that <i>I</i> left&mdash;&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, she has. Why trouble to deny it? You
did leave&mdash;By the way, have you a brother or any
other relative in London&mdash;&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>I&mdash;I</i>, sir! A brother? Ah, mon Dieu! Oh,
but, sir&mdash;&mdash;!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Really you must calm yourself. You went away
from the Exhibition at an early hour. There is no
doubt about it, and you must have a brother or some
person deeply interested in you, for some man afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg&nbsp;236]</span>
got hold of the cook, Bertha Seward, and
begged her for Heaven&#39;s sake not to mention your
departure from the Exhibition that night. He gave
her money&mdash;she told me so. And Inspector Clarke
knows it, as well as I, for Hester Seward has told
me that he went to question her&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;M&#39;sieur <i>Clarke</i>!&quot;&mdash;at the name of &quot;Clarke,&quot;
which she whispered after him, the girl&#39;s face turned
a more ghastly gray, for Clarke was the ogre, the
griffon, the dragon of her recent life, at the mere
mention of whom her heart leaped guiltily. Suddenly,
abandoning the struggle, she fell back from
her sitting posture, tried to hide her face in the bedclothes,
and sobbed wildly:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t do it! I didn&#39;t do it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do what? Who said you had done anything?&quot;
asked Winter. &quot;It isn&#39;t <i>you</i> that Mr. Clarke suspects,
you silly child, it is a man named&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She looked up with frenzied eyes to hear the name&mdash;but
Winter stopped. In his hands the unhappy
Pauline was a little hedge-bird in the talons of a hawk.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Named?&quot; she repeated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind his name.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She buried her head afresh, giving out another
heart-rending sob, and from her smothered lips came
the words:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It wasn&#39;t I&mdash;it was&mdash;it was&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was who?&quot; asked Winter.</p>

<p class="indent">She shivered through the whole of her delicate
frame, and a low murmur came from her throat:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg&nbsp;237]</span>
&quot;You have seen the diary&mdash;it was Monsieur Furneaux.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Oddly enough, despite his own black conviction,
this was not what Winter expected to hear.</p>

<p class="indent">He started, and said sharply:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you are stupid. Why are you saying things
that you know nothing of?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;May Heaven forgive me for accusing anyone,&quot;
she sobbed hoarsely. &quot;But it was not anybody else.
It could not be. You have seen the diary&mdash;it was
Mr. Furneaux, or it was Mr. Osborne.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, two accusations now,&quot; cried Winter. &quot;Furneaux
or Osborne! You are trying to shield someone?
What motive could Mr. Furneaux, or Mr.
Osborne, have for such an act?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was not Mr. Osborne her lover? And was not
Mr. Furneaux her&mdash;husband?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Her&mdash;&mdash;!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In that awesome moment Winter hardly realized
what he said. Half starting out of his chair, he
glared in stupor at the shrinking figure on the bed,
while every drop of blood fled away from his own
face.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a long silence. Then Winter, bending
over her, spoke almost in the whisper of those who
share a shameful secret.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You say that Mr. Furneaux was her husband?
You know it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She trembled violently, but nerved herself to answer:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg&nbsp;238]</span>
&quot;Yes, I know it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me everything. You must! Do you understand?
I order you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She told me herself when we were friends. She
was married to him in the church of St. Germain
l&#39;Auxerrois in Paris on the 7th of November in the
year &#39;98. But she soon left him, since he had not
the means to support her. I have her marriage certificate
in my trunk.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter sat some minutes spellbound, his big round
eyes staring at the girl, but not seeing her, his forehead
glistening. This, then, supplied the long-sought
motive. The unfaithful wife was about to
marry another. This was the key. An affrighting
callousness possessed him. He became the cold, unbending
official again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must get up at once, and give me that certificate,&quot;
he said in the tone of authority, and went
out of the room. In a little while she placed the
paper in his hands, and he went away with it. Were
she not so distraught she might have seen that it
shook in his fingers.</p>

<p class="indent">Now he, like Clarke, held all the threads of an
amazing case.</p>

<p class="indent">The next afternoon Furneaux was to arrest Osborne&mdash;it
was for him, Winter, then, to anticipate
such an outrage by the swift arrest of Furneaux.
But was he quite ready? He wished he could secure
another day&#39;s grace to collate and systematize each
link of his evidence, and he hurried to Osborne&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg&nbsp;239]</span>
house in order to give Osborne a hint to vanish again
for a day or two. Nevertheless, when at the very
door, he paused, refrained, thought that he would
manage things differently, and went away.</p>

<p class="indent">On one of the blinds of the library as he passed
he saw the shadow of a head&mdash;of Osborne&#39;s head in
fact, who in that hour of despair was sitting there,
bowed down, hopeless now of finding Rosalind, whom
he believed to be dead.</p>

<p class="indent">Though Mrs. Marsh had that evening received a
note from Janoc: &quot;Your daughter is alive,&quot; as yet
Osborne knew nothing of it. He was mourning his
loss in solitude when a letter was brought to him by
Jenkins. He tore it open. After an uncomprehending
glare at the written words he suddenly
grasped their meaning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="indent">The writer believes that your ex-secretary, Miss Hylda
Prout, could tell you where Miss Rosalind Marsh is imprisoned.</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;Imprisoned!&quot; That was the word that pierced
the gloom and struck deepest. She was alive, then&mdash;that
was joy. But a prisoner&mdash;in what hole of
blackness? Subject to what risks? In whose power?
In ten seconds he was rushing out of the house, and
was gone.</p>

<p class="indent">During the enforced respite of a journey in a cab
he looked again at the mysterious note. It was a
man&#39;s hand; small, neat writing; no signature. Who
could have written it? But his brain had no room
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg&nbsp;240]</span>
for guessing. He looked out to cry to the driver:
&quot;A sovereign for a quick run.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To his woe, Hylda Prout was not in her lodgings
when he arrived there. During the last few days
he had known nothing of her movements. After that
flare-up of passion in the library, the relation of
master and servant had, of course, come to an end
between them; and the lady of the house in Holland
Park where Hylda rented two rooms told him that
Miss Prout had gone to see her brother for the weekend,
and was not expected back till noon on the
following day.</p>

<p class="indent">And Osborne did not know where her brother lived!
His night was dismal with a horror of sleeplessness.</p>

<p class="indent">Long before midday he was in Hylda&#39;s sitting-room,
only to pace it to and fro in an agony of
impatience till two o&#39;clock&mdash;and then she came.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I have waited hours&mdash;weary hours!&quot; he cried
with a reproach that seemed to sweep aside the need
for explanations.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am so sorry!&mdash;sit here with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She touched his hand, leading him to a couch and
sitting near him, her hat still on, a flush on her
pale face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hylda&quot;&mdash;her heart leapt: he called her
&quot;Hylda&quot;!&mdash;&quot;you know where Miss Marsh is.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She sprang to her feet in a passion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So it is to talk to me about another woman that
you have come? I who have humbled myself, lost
my self-respect&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg&nbsp;241]</span>
Osborne, too, stood up, stung to the quick by this
mood of hers, so foreign to the disease of impatience
and care in which he was being consumed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My good girl,&quot; he said, &quot;are you going to be
reasonable?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come, then,&quot; she retorted, &quot;let us be reasonable.&quot;
She sat down again, her hands crossed on her lap,
a passionate vindictiveness in her pursed lips, but a
mock humility in her attitude.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me! tell me! Where shall I find her?&quot; and
he bent in eager pleading.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. How is it possible that I should tell you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you do know! Somehow you do! I see
and feel it. Tell it me, Hylda! Where is she?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She looked up at him with a smiling face which
gave no hint of the asp&#39;s nest of jealousy which the
sight of his agony and longing created in her bosom.
And from those calm lips furious words came out:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, I horribly hate the woman&mdash;and since I
happen to know that she is suffering most vilely, do
you think it likely that I would tell you where she
is?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He groaned, as his heart sank, his head dropped,
his hope died. He moved slowly away to a window;
then, with a frantic rush was back to her, on his
knees, telling her of his wealth&mdash;it was more than
she could measure!&mdash;and he had a checkbook in his
pocket&mdash;all, one might say, was hers&mdash;she had only
to name a sum&mdash;a hundred thousand, two hundred&mdash;anything&mdash;luxury
for life, mansions, position&mdash;just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg&nbsp;242]</span>
for one little word, one little act of womanly kindliness.</p>

<p class="indent">When he stopped for lack of breath, she covered
her eyes with the back of her hand, and began to
cry; he saw her lips stretched in the tension of her
emotion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why do you cry?&mdash;that achieves nothing&mdash;listen&mdash;&mdash;&quot;
he panted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To be offered money&mdash;to be so wounded&mdash;I
who&mdash;&mdash;&quot; She could not go on.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My God! Then I offer you&mdash;what you will&mdash;my
friendship&mdash;my gratitude&mdash;my affection&mdash;only
speak&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For another woman! Slave that you are to her!
she is sweet to you, is she, in your heart? But she
shall never have you&mdash;be sure of that&mdash;not while I
draw the breath of life! If you want her free, I
will sell myself for nothing less than yourself&mdash;you
must marry me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her astounding demand struck him dumb. He
picked himself slowly up from her feet, walked again
to the window, and stood with his back to her&mdash;a
long time. Once she saw his head drop, heard him
sob, heard the words: &quot;Oh, no, not that&quot;; and she
sat, white and silent, watching him.</p>

<p class="indent">When he returned to her his eyes were calm, his
face of a grim and stern pallor. He sat by her,
took her hand, laid his lips on it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You speak of marriage,&quot; he said gently, &quot;but
just think what kind of a marriage that would be&mdash;forced,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg&nbsp;243]</span>
on one side&mdash;I full of resentment against
you for the rest of my life&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus did he try to reason with her, tried to show
her a better way, offering to vow not to marry anyone
for two years, during which he promised to see
whether he could not acquire for her those feelings
which a husband&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">But she cut him short coldly. In two years she
would be dead without him. She would kill herself.
Life lived in pain was a thing of no value&mdash;a human
life of no more value than a fly&#39;s. If he would marry
her, she would tell him where Miss Marsh was: and,
after the marriage, if he did not love her, she knew
a way of setting him free&mdash;though, even in that
case, Rosalind Marsh should never have him&mdash;she,
Hylda, would see to that.</p>

<p class="indent">For the first time in his life Osborne knew what
it was to hate. He, the man accused of murder,
felt like a murderer, but he had grown strangely
wise, and realized that this woman would die cheerfully
rather than reveal her secret. He left her
once more, stood ten minutes at the window&mdash;then
laughed harshly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I agree,&quot; he said quite coolly, turning to
her.</p>

<p class="indent">She, too, was outwardly cool, though heaven and
hell fought together in her bosom. She held out
to him a Bible. He kissed it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This day week,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[pg&nbsp;244]</span>
She wrote on a piece of paper the address of a
house in Poland Street; and handed it to him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Marsh is there,&quot; she said, as though she
were his secretary of former days, in the most business-like
way.</p>

<p class="indent">He walked straight out without another word,
without a bow to her.</p>

<p class="indent">When he was well out of the house he began to
run madly, for there was no cab in sight. But he
had not run far when he collided with Inspector
Furneaux.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Osborne,&quot; said Furneaux&mdash;&quot;one word. I
think you are interested in the disappearance of Miss
Marsh? Well, I am happy to say that I am in a
position to tell you where that lady is.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He looked with a glitter of really fiendish malice
in his eyes at the unhappy man who leant against a
friendly wall, his face white as death.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you ill, sir?&quot; asked Furneaux, with mock
solicitude.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, man, your information is a minute late,&quot;
muttered Osborne; &quot;I have it already&mdash;I have
bought it.&quot; He held out the paper with the address
in Poland Street.</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux gazed at him steadily as he leant there,
looking ready to drop; then suddenly, eagerly, he
said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You say &#39;<i>bought</i>&#39;: do you mean with money?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, not with money&mdash;with my youth, with my
life!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg&nbsp;245]</span>
Furneaux seemed to murmur to himself: &quot;As I
hoped!&quot; And now the glitter of malice passed away
from his softened eyes, his forehead flushed a little,
out went his hand to Osborne, who, in a daze of
misery, without in the least understanding why, mechanically
shook it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Surely, Mr. Osborne,&quot; said Furneaux, &quot;Miss
Marsh would consider that a noble deed of you, if
she knew it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She will never know it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, never is a long time. One must be more
or less hopeful. Unfortunately, I am compelled to
inform you that I am here to arrest you&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Me? At last! For the murder?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was to be, Mr. Osborne. But, come, you
shall first have the joy of setting free Miss Marsh,
to whom you have given so much&mdash;there&#39;s a cab&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Osborne followed him into the cab with a reeling
brain. Yet he smiled vacantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope I shall be hanged,&quot; he said, in a sort of
self-communing. &quot;That will be better than marriage&mdash;better,
too, than deserving to be hanged,
which might have been true of me a few minutes ago.
Why, I killed a woman in thought just now&mdash;killed
her, with my hands. Yes, this is better. I should
hate to have done that wretched thing, but now I am
safe&mdash;safe from&mdash;myself.&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br/>
THE ARRESTS</h2>

<p class="indent">As Furneaux and Osborne were being driven rapidly
to Poland Street, bent on the speedy release of
Rosalind, Inspector Winter, for his part, was seeking
for Furneaux in a fury of haste, eager to arrest
his colleague before the latter could arrest Osborne.
At the same time Clarke, determined to bring matters
to a climax by arresting Janoc, was lurking about
a corner of Old Compton Street, every moment expecting
the passing of his quarry. Each man was
acting without a warrant. The police are empowered
to arrest &quot;on suspicion,&quot; and each of the three
could produce proof in plenty to convict his man.</p>

<p class="indent">As for Winter, he knew that where Osborne was
Furneaux would not be far that day. Hence, when
in the forenoon he received notice from one of his
watchers that Furneaux had that morning deliberately
fled from observation, he bade his man watch
Osborne&#39;s steps with one eye, while the other searched
the offing for the shadow of Furneaux, on the sound
principle that &quot;wheresoever the carcase is, there will
the eagles be gathered together.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus Osborne&#39;s ride to Holland Park to see Hylda
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg&nbsp;247]</span>
Prout had been followed; and, two hours afterwards,
while he was still waiting for Hylda&#39;s arrival, Winter&#39;s
spy from behind the frosted glass of a public-house
bar had watched Furneaux&#39;s arrival and long
wait on the pavement. He promptly telephoned the
fact to Winter, and Winter was about to set out
westward from Scotland Yard when the detective
telephoned afresh to say that Mr. Osborne had appeared
out of the house, and had been accosted by
Furneaux. The watcher, quite a smart youngster
from a suburban station, hastened from his hiding-place.
Evidently, Furneaux was careless of espionage
at that moment. He hailed a cab without
so much as a glance at the man passing close to
Osborne and himself on the pavement, and it was
easy to overhear the address given to the driver&mdash;a
house in Poland Street.</p>

<p class="indent">Why to Poland Street Winter could not conceive.
At all events, the fact that the drive was not to a
police-station inspired him with the hope that Osborne&#39;s
arrest was for some reason not yet an accomplished
fact, and he, too, set off for Poland Street,
which happily lay much nearer Scotland Yard than
Holland Park.</p>

<p class="indent">Meantime, Osborne and Furneaux were hastening
eastward in silence, Osborne with his head bent between
his clenched hands, and an expression of face
as wrenched with pain as that of a man racked with
neuralgia. It was now that he began to feel in
reality the tremendousness of the vow he had just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[pg&nbsp;248]</span>
made to marry Hylda Prout, in order to set Rosalind
free. Compared to that his impending arrest
was too little a thing for him to care about. But
as they were spinning along by Kensington Gardens,
a twinge of curiosity prompted him to ask why he
was to be arrested now, after being assured repeatedly
that the police would not formulate any charge
against him.</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux looked straight in front of him, and
when he answered, his voice was metallic.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There was no escaping it, Mr. Osborne,&quot; he said.
&quot;But be thankful for small mercies. I was waiting
there in the street for you, intending to pounce on
you at once, but when I knew that you had sacrificed
yourself for Miss Marsh, I thought, &#39;He deserves
to be permitted to release her&#39;: for, to promise to
marry Miss Prout&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you saying? How could you possibly
know that I promised to marry Miss Prout?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Osborne&#39;s brain was still seething, but some glimmer
of his wonted clear judgment warned him of the
exceeding oddity of the detective&#39;s remark.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you told me that you had &#39;bought&#39; the
knowledge of her whereabouts with &#39;your youth and
your life&#39;&mdash;so I assumed that there could be no other
explanation.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Still, that is singularly deep guessing&mdash;&mdash;!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, if you demand greater accuracy, I foresaw
exactly what would be the result of your interview
with your late secretary, in case you really did care
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg&nbsp;249]</span>
for Miss Marsh. Therefore, I brought about the
interview because&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>You</i> brought it about?&quot; cried Osborne in a
crescendo of astonishment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. You see I am candid. You are aware
that I knew where Miss Marsh could be found, and I
might have given you the information direct. But
I preferred to write a note telling you that you must
depend on Miss Prout for tidings.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! it was you, then, who sent that note! But
how cruel, how savagely cruel! Could you not have
told me yourself? Don&#39;t you realize that your detestable
action has bound me for life to a woman
whom&mdash;Oh, I hope, since you are about to arrest me,
that you will prove me guilty, for if I live, life henceforth
will hold nothing for me save Dead Sea fruit!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He covered his eyes, but Furneaux, whose face was
twitching curiously, laid a hand on his knee, and said
in a low voice:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do not despair. You are not the only man in
the world who suffers. I had reasons&mdash;and strong
reasons&mdash;for acting in this manner. One reason
was that I was uncertain of the depth of your affection
for Miss Marsh, and I wished to be as certain
as you have now made me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But how on earth could that concern you, the
depth or shallowness of my affection for Miss
Marsh?&quot; asked Osborne in a white heat of anger
and indignation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nevertheless, it did concern me,&quot; answered Furneaux
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg&nbsp;250]</span>
dryly; &quot;I cannot, at present, explain everything
to you. I had a suspicion that your affection
for Miss Marsh was trivial: if it had been, you would
then have shown a criminal forgetfulness of the dead
woman whom so recently you said you loved. In
that event, you would have found me continuing the
part I have played in regard to you&mdash;anything
but a friend. As matters stand, I say I may yet
earn your gratitude for what to-day you call my
cruelty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Osborne passed his hands across his eyes wearily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I fear I can neither talk myself, nor quite understand
what you mean by your words,&quot; he murmured.
&quot;My poor head is rather in a whirl. You see, I have
given my promise&mdash;I have sworn on the Bible to that
woman&mdash;nothing can ever alter that, or release me
now. I am&mdash;done for&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His chin dropped on his breast. He had the
semblance of a man who had lost all&mdash;for whom death
had no terrors.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nevertheless, I tell you that I forecasted the result
of your interview with Hylda Prout,&quot; persisted
Furneaux. &quot;Even now I do not see your reason
for despair. I knew that Miss Prout had an ardent
attachment to you; I said to myself: &#39;She will surely
seek to sell the information in her possession for
what she most longs for, and the possibility is that
Osborne may yield to her terms&mdash;always provided
that his attachment to the other lady is profound.
If it is not profound, I find out by this device;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg&nbsp;251]</span>
if it is profound, he becomes engaged to Miss Prout,
which is a result that I greatly wish to bring about
before his arrest.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My God! why?&quot; asked Osborne, looking up in
a tense agony that might have moved a less sardonic
spirit.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For certain police reasons,&quot; said Furneaux, smiling
with the smug air of one who has given an irrefutable
answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But what a price <i>I</i> pay for these police reasons!
Is this fair, Inspector Furneaux? Now, in Heaven&#39;s
name, is this fair? Life-long misery on the one
hand, and some trick of officialism on the other!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The detective seemed to think the conversation at
an end, since he sat in silence and stared blankly out
of the window.</p>

<p class="indent">Osborne shrank into his corner, quite drooping and
pinched with misery, and brooded over his misfortunes.
Presently he started, and asked furiously:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In what possible way did Hylda Prout come to
know where Miss Marsh was hidden, to use your own
ridiculous word?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Prout happens to be a really clever woman,&quot;
answered Furneaux. &quot;In the times of Richelieu she
would have governed France from an <i>alcôve</i>. You
had better ask her herself how she obtained her knowledge.
Still, I don&#39;t mind telling you that Miss
Marsh has been imprisoned in a wine-cellar by a
certain Anarchist, a great man in his way, and that
your former secretary has of late days developed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg&nbsp;252]</span>
quite an intimate acquaintance with Anarchist
circles&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anarchist?&quot; gasped Osborne. &quot;My Rosalind&mdash;imprisoned
in a wine-cellar?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is a tangled skein,&quot; purred Furneaux with a
self-satisfied smirk; &quot;I am afraid we haven&#39;t time
now to go into it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The cab crossed Oxford Circus&mdash;two minutes
more and they were in Soho.</p>

<p class="indent">Winter at that moment was on the lookout for
Furneaux at the corner of a shabby street which
traverses Poland Street. As for Clarke, he had
vanished from the nook in Compton Street where he
was loitering in the belief that Janoc would soon
pass. In order to understand exactly the amazing
events that were now reaching their crisis it is necessary
to go back half an hour and see how matters
had fared with Clarke....</p>

<p class="indent">During his long vigil, he, in turn, had been watched
most intently by the Italian, Antonio, who, quickly
becoming suspicious, hastened to a barber&#39;s shop,
kept by a compatriot, where Janoc was in hiding.
Into this shop he pitched to pant a frenzied
warning.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sauriac says that Inspector Clarke has been
up your stairs&mdash;may have entered your rooms&mdash;and
I myself have just seen him prowling round Old
Compton Street!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Agitation mastered Janoc; he, who so despised
those bunglers, the police, now began to fear them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[pg&nbsp;253]</span>
Out he pelted, careless of consequences, and Antonio
after him.</p>

<p class="indent">He made straight for his third-floor back, and,
losing a few seconds in his eagerness to unlock the
door, rushed to the trunk in which he had left the
two daggers, meaning to do away with them once
and for all.</p>

<p class="indent">And now he knew how he had blundered in keeping
them. He looked in the trunk and saw, not the
daggers, but the gallows!</p>

<p class="indent">For the first time in his life he nearly fainted.
Political desperadoes of his type are often neurotic&mdash;weak
as women when the hour of trial is at hand,
but strong as women when the spirit has subdued
the flesh. During some moments of sheer despair
he knelt there, broken, swaying, with clasped hands
and livid face. Then he stood up slowly, with some
degree of calmness, with no little dignity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are gone,&quot; he said to Antonio, pointing
tragically.</p>

<p class="indent">Antonio&#39;s hands tore at his hair, his black eyes
glared out of their red rims with the look of a hunted
animal that hears the hounds baying in close pursuit.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This means the sure conviction either of her or
me,&quot; went on Janoc. &quot;My efforts have failed&mdash;I
must confess to the murder.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My friend!&quot; cried Antonio.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Set free Miss Marsh for me,&quot; said Janoc, and he
walked down the stairs, without haste, yet briskly&mdash;Antonio
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[pg&nbsp;254]</span>
following him at some distance behind, with
awe, with reverence, as one follows a conqueror.</p>

<p class="indent">Janoc went unfalteringly to his doom. Clarke,
seeing him come, chuckled and lounged toward him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is for me you wait&mdash;yes?&quot; said Janoc, pale,
but strong.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There may be something in <i>that</i>,&quot; said Clarke,
though he was slightly taken aback by the question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have the daggers&mdash;yes?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This staggered him even more, but he managed
to growl:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You may be sure of that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I confess! I did it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At last! The garish street suddenly assumed
roseate tints in the detective&#39;s eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you do?&quot; he cried thickly. &quot;You confess
that you killed Rose de Bercy on the night of the
3d of July at Feldisham Mansions?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I confess it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Clarke laid a hand on Janoc&#39;s sleeve, and the two
walked away.</p>

<p class="indent">As for Antonio, in an ecstasy of excitement he
cast his eyes and his arms on high together, crying
out, &quot;<i>O Dio mio!</i>&quot; and the next moment was rushing
to find a cab to take him to Porchester Gardens.
Arrived there, he rang, and the instant Pauline appeared,
she being now sufficiently recovered to attend
to her duties, his right hand went out in a warning
clutch at her shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your brother is arrested!&quot; he cried.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg&nbsp;255]</span>
With her clenched fists drawn back, she glared
crazily at him, and her face reddened for a little
while, as if she were furious at the outrage and suddenness
of his news. Then her cheeks whitened, she
went faint, sank back into the shelter of the hall,
and leant against an inner doorway, her eyes closed,
her lips parted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Pauline, be brave!&quot; said Antonio, and tears
choked his voice.</p>

<p class="indent">After a time, without opening her eyes, she asked:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What proofs have they?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They have found the daggers in his trunk.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But <i>I</i> have the daggers!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, that woman who lived here, your supposed
friend, Miss Marsh, stole the daggers from you, and
Janoc secured them from her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She moaned, but did not weep. She, who had been
timid as a mouse at sight of Clarke, was now braver
than the man. Presently she whispered:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where have they taken him to?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He will have been taken to the Marlborough
Street police-station.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After another silence she said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you, Antonio; leave me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Passionately he kissed her hand in silence, and
went.</p>

<p class="indent">She was no sooner alone than she walked up to
her room, dressed herself in clothes suited for an out-of-door
mission, and went out, heedless and dumb when
a wondering fellow-servant protested. She called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[pg&nbsp;256]</span>
a cab&mdash;for Marlborough Street; and now she was
as calm and strong as had been her brother when he
gave himself up to Clarke.</p>

<p class="indent">Her cab crossed Oxford Circus about ten minutes
ahead of the vehicle which carried Furneaux and
Osborne; and as she turned south to enter Marlborough
Street, she saw Winter, who had lately visited
her, standing at a corner awaiting the arrival of
Furneaux.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stop!&quot; Pauline cried to her driver: and she
alighted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you are better, I see,&quot; said Winter, who
did not wish to be bothered by her at that moment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sir,&quot; said Pauline solemnly in her stilted English,
&quot;I regret having been so unjust as to tell you
that it was either Mr. Furneaux or Mr. Osborne who
committed that murder, since it was I myself who
did it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What!&quot; roared Winter, stepping backward, and
startled most effectually out of his official phlegm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sir,&quot; said Pauline again, gravely, calmly, &quot;it
was not a murder, it was an assassination, done for
political reasons. As I have no mercy to expect,
so I have no pardon to ask, and no act to blush
at. It was political. I give myself into your
custody.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter stood aghast. His brain seemed suddenly
to have curdled; everything in the world was topsy-turvy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So that was why you left the Exhibition&mdash;to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg&nbsp;257]</span>
kill that poor woman, Pauline Dessaulx?&quot; he contrived
to say.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is the truth, sir. I could bear to keep it
secret no longer, and was going now to the police-station
to give myself up, when I saw you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Still Winter made no move. He stood there,
frowning in thought, staring at nothing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And all the proofs I have gathered against&mdash;against
someone else&mdash;all these are false?&quot; he muttered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am afraid so, sir,&quot; said Pauline, &quot;since it was
I who did it with my own hands.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And Mr. Osborne&#39;s dagger and flint&mdash;where do
they come in?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was I who stole them from Mr. Osborne&#39;s
museum, sir, to throw suspicion upon him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, come along,&quot; growled Winter. &quot;I believe,
I know, you are lying, but this must be inquired
into.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Not unkindly, acting more like a man in a dream
than an officer of the law, he took her arm, led her
to the cab from which she had just descended, and
the two drove away together to the police-station
higher up the street.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus, and thus only, was Inspector Furneaux
saved from arrest that day. Two minutes later he
and Osborne passed the very spot where Pauline
found Winter, and reached Poland Street without
interference.</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux produced a bunch of keys when he ran
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>[pg&nbsp;258]</span>
up the steps of the house. He unlocked the door
at once, and the two men entered. Evidently Furneaux
had been there before, for he hurried without
hesitation down the kitchen stairs, put a key into
the cellar door, flung it open, and Osborne, peering
wildly over his shoulder, caught a glimpse of Rosalind
sitting on the ground in a corner.</p>

<p class="indent">She did not look up when they entered&mdash;apparently
she thought it was Janoc who had come, and
with fixed, mournful eyes, like one gazing into profundities
of vacancy, she continued to stare at the
floor. Her face and air were so pitiable that the
hearts of the men smote them into dumbness.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">She did not look up when they entered</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Page 258</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="indent">Then, half conscious of some new thing, she must
have caught sight of two men instead of the usual
one, for she looked up sharply; and in another moment
was staggering to her feet, all hysterical laughter
and sobbings, like a dying light that flickers
wildly up and burns low alternately, trying at one
instant to be herself and calm, when she laughed,
and the next yielding to her distress, when she sobbed.
She put out her hand to Osborne in a last effort to
be graceful and usual; then she yielded the struggle,
and fainted in his arms.</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux produced a scent-bottle and a crushed
cigar, such as it was his habit to smell, to present
them to her nose....</p>

<p class="indent">But she did not revive, so Osborne took her in
his arms, and carried her, as though she were a child,
up the stone steps, and up the wooden, and out to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg&nbsp;259]</span>
the cab. Furneaux allowed him to drive alone with
her, himself following behind in another cab, which
was a most singular proceeding on the part of a
detective who had arrested a man accused of an
atrocious murder.</p>

<p class="indent">Half-way to Porchester Gardens Rosalind opened
her eyes, and a wild, heartrending cry came from
her parched lips.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will have no more wine nor water&mdash;let me die!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Try and keep still, just a few moments, my dear
one!&quot; he murmured, smiling a fond smile of pain,
and clasping her more tightly in a protecting arm.
&quot;You are going home, to your mother. You will
soon be there, safe, with her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot;&mdash;Then she recognized him, though there
was still an uncanny wildness in her eyes. &quot;I am
free&mdash;it is you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She seemed to falter for words, but raised her
hands instinctively to her hair, knowing it to be all
rumpled and dusty. Instinctively, too, she caught
her hat from her knee, and put it on hurriedly. She
could not know what stabs of pain these little feminine
anxieties caused her lover. No spoken words
could have portrayed the sufferings she had endured
like unto her pitiful efforts to conceal their ravages.
At last she recovered sufficiently to ask if her mother
expected her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not sure,&quot; said Osborne. &quot;I am not your
deliverer; Inspector Furneaux discovered where you
were, and went to your rescue.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[pg&nbsp;260]</span>
&quot;But you are with him?&quot; and an appealing note
of love, of complete confidence, crept into her voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I merely happen to be with him, because he is
now taking me to a felon&#39;s cell. But he lets me
come in the cab with you, because he trusts me not
to run away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His smile was very sad and humble, and he laid
his disengaged hand on hers, yielding to a craving
for sympathy in his forlornness. But memories were
now thronging fast on her mind, and she drew herself
away from both hand and arm. She recalled
that her last sight of him was when in the embrace
of Hylda Prout in his library; and, mixed with that
vision of infamy, was a memory of her letter that
had been opened, whose opening he had denied to her.</p>

<p class="indent">And that snatch of her hand as from a toad&#39;s
touch, that shrinking from the pressure of his arm,
froze him back into his loneliness of misery. They
remained silent, each in a corner, a world between
them, till the cab was nearly at the door in Porchester
Gardens. Then he could not help saying
from the depths of a heavy heart:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Probably I shall never see you again! It is
good-by now; and no more Rosalind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The words were uttered in a tone of such heart-rending
sadness that they touched some nerve of
pity in her. But she could find nothing to say,
other than a quite irrelevant comment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will tell my mother of your consideration for
me. At least, we shall thank you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[pg&nbsp;261]</span>
&quot;If ever you hear anything&mdash;of me&mdash;that looks
black&mdash;&mdash;&quot; he tried to tell her, thinking of his coming
marriage with Hylda Prout, but the explanation
choked in his throat; he only managed to gasp in a
quick appeal of sorrow: &quot;Oh, remember me a little!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The cab was at the door. She put out her hand,
and he shook it; but did not offer to escort her
inside the house. It was Furneaux who led her up
the steps, and Osborne heard from within a shrill
outcry from Mrs. Marsh. Furneaux waited until
the door was closed. Then he rejoined Osborne.
They went, without exchanging a syllable of talk,
to Marlborough Street police-station, where Janoc
and his sister were already lodged. Arrived there,
Furneaux formally arrested him, &quot;on suspicion,&quot;
charged with the murder of Rose de Bercy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But why <i>now</i>?&quot; asked Osborne again. &quot;What
has happened to implicate me now more than before?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, many things have happened, and will happen,
that as yet you know nothing of,&quot; said Furneaux,
smiling at the stolid station inspector, a man
incapable of any emotion, even of surprise, and Osborne
was led away to be searched for concealed
weapons, or poison, before being placed in a cell.</p>

<p class="indent">Half an hour afterwards Furneaux walked into
Winter&#39;s quarters. His chief, writing hard, hardly
glanced up, and for some time Furneaux stood looking
at his one-time friend with the eyes of a scientist
who contemplates a new fossil.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[pg&nbsp;262]</span>
&quot;Well, I have Osborne safe,&quot; he said at last.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have, have you?&quot; muttered Winter, scribbling
rapidly; but a flush of anger rose on his forehead,
and he added: &quot;It will cost you your reputation,
my good fellow!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that all?&quot; cried Furneaux mockingly. &quot;Why,
I was looking out for worse things than that!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter threw down his pen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You informed me last night,&quot; he snarled, &quot;that
by this hour Miss Marsh would have returned to her
home. I need not ask&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have just taken her there,&quot; remarked the other
coolly.</p>

<p class="indent">Winter was thoroughly nonplused. Everybody,
everything, seemed to be mad. He was staring at
Furneaux when Clarke entered. The newcomer&#39;s
hat was tilted a little backward, and there was an
air of business-like haste in him from the creak of
his boot soles to the drops of perspiration shining
on his brow. He contrived to hold himself back just
long enough to say, &quot;Hello, Furneaux!&quot; and then
his burden of news broke from him:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I&#39;ve got Janoc under lock and key all
right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, <i>you&#39;ve</i> got somebody, too, have you?&quot;
groaned Winter. &quot;And on what charge, pray, have
you collared Janoc?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, what a question!&quot; cried Clarke. &quot;Didn&#39;t
I tell you, sir&mdash;&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So true,&quot; said Winter; &quot;I had almost forgotten.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>[pg&nbsp;263]</span>
<i>You</i>&#39;ve grabbed Janoc, and the genius of Mr. Furneaux
is sated by arresting Mr. Osborne&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Clarke slapped his thigh vigorously, doubling up
in a paroxysm of laughter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Osborne! Oh, not Osborne at this time of day!&quot;
He leered at Furneaux in comic wonder&mdash;he, who
had never dared question aught done by the little
man, save in the safe privacy of his thoughts.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I have arrested Pauline,&quot; said Winter in
grim irony.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who has?&quot; asked Clarke, suddenly agape.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I, I say. Pauline is <i>my</i> prize. <i>I</i> wouldn&#39;t be
left out in the cold.&quot; And he added bitterly: &quot;We&#39;ve
all got one!&mdash;<i>all</i> guilty!&mdash;a lovely story it will make
for the newspapers. I suppose, to keep up the
screaming farce, that we each ought to contrive to
have our prisoner tried in a different court!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Clarke&#39;s hands went akimbo. He swelled visibly,
grew larger, taller, and looked down from his Olympus
at the others.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But <i>I</i> never dream at night,&quot; he cried. &quot;When
<i>I</i> arrest a man for murder he is going to be hanged.
You see, <i>Janoc has confessed</i>&mdash;that&#39;s all: he has confessed!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter leaped up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Confessed!&quot; he hissed, unable to believe his ears.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s just it,&quot; said Clarke&mdash;&quot;confessed!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But Pauline has confessed, too!&quot; Winter almost
screamed, confronting his subordinate like an adversary.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[pg&nbsp;264]</span>
And while Clarke shrank, and gaped in dumb wonder,
Furneaux, looking from one to the other, burst
out laughing. Never a word he said, but turned in
his quick way to leave the room. He was already
in the corridor when Winter shouted:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come back, Furneaux!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not I,&quot; was the defiant retort.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come back, or I shall have you brought back!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter was in a white rage, but Furneaux pressed
on daringly, whistling a tune, and never looking
round. Clarke, momentarily expecting the roof of
Scotland Yard to fall in, gazed from Furneaux to
Winter and from Winter to Furneaux until the diminutive
Jersey man had vanished round an angle
of a long passage.</p>

<p class="indent">But nothing happened. Winter was beaten to his
knees, and he knew it.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>[pg&nbsp;265]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br/>
CLEARING THE AIR</h2>

<p class="indent">Winter was far too strong a man to remain long
buried in the pit of humiliation into which Furneaux,
aided unwittingly by Clarke, had cast him. The
sounds of Furneaux&#39;s jaunty footsteps had barely
died away before he shoved aside the papers on which
he had been engaged previously, and reached across
the table for a box of cigars.</p>

<p class="indent">He took one, and shoved the box towards Clarke,
whose face was still glistening in evidence of his
rush from Marlborough Street police-station.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here, you crack-pate!&quot; he said, &quot;smoke; it may
clear your silly head.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I can&#39;t repeat too often that Janoc has
confessed&mdash;<i>confessed</i>!&quot; and Clarke&#39;s voice rose almost
to a squeal on that final word.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So has his sister confessed. In an hour or two,
when the silence and horror of a cell have done their
work, we shall have Osborne confessing, too. Oh,
man, man, can&#39;t you see that Furneaux has twisted
each of us round his little finger?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But&mdash;sir&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; cried Winter, in a fume of wrath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>[pg&nbsp;266]</span>
and smoke. &quot;Believe these foreign idiots and we
shall be hearing of a masked tribunal, glistening
with daggers, a brace of revolvers in every belt&mdash;a
dozen or more infuriated conspirators, cloaked in
gaberdines, gathered in a West End flat, while a red-headed
woman harangues them. Furneaux has fooled
us, I tell you&mdash;deliberately brought the Yard into
discredit&mdash;made us the laughing-stock of the public.
Oh, I shall never&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He pulled himself up, for Clarke was listening with
the ears of a rabbit. Luckily, the detective&#39;s ideas
were too self-concentrated to extract much food for
thought from these disjointed outpourings.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t wish to seem wanting in respect, sir,&quot;
he said doggedly, &quot;but have you forgotten the
diary? Why, Rose de Bercy herself wrote that she
would be killed either by C. E. F. or Janoc.
Now&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did she mention Janoc?&quot; interrupted Winter
sharply. &quot;In what passage? I certainly <i>have</i> forgotten
that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Clarke, stubborn as a mule, stuck to his point,
though he felt that he had committed himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps I did wrong,&quot; he growled savagely,
&quot;but I couldn&#39;t help myself. You were against me
all along, sir&mdash;now, weren&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">No answer. Winter waited, and did not even look
at him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What was I to do?&quot; he went on in desperation.
&quot;You took me off the job just as I was getting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>[pg&nbsp;267]</span>
keen in it. Then I happened upon Janoc, and found
his sister, and when I came across that blacked-out
name in the diary I scraped it and sponged it until
I could read what was written beneath. The name
was Janoc!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was it?&quot; said Winter, gazing at him at last
with a species of contempt. &quot;And to throw dust
in my eyes&mdash;in the eyes of your superior officer&mdash;you
inked it out again?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You wouldn&#39;t believe,&quot; muttered Clarke. &quot;Why,
you don&#39;t know half this story. I haven&#39;t told you
yet how I found the daggers&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t say,&quot; mocked Winter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I do, I did,&quot; cried Clarke, beside himself
with excitement. &quot;I took them out of Janoc&#39;s
lodgings, and put them in a cab. I would have them
in my hands this minute if some d&mdash;d thing hadn&#39;t
occurred, some trick of fate&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter stooped and unlocked a drawer in his writing-desk.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are these your daggers?&quot; he demanded, though
Clarke was shrewd enough, if in possession of his
usual senses, to have caught the note of suppressed
astonishment in the Chief Inspector&#39;s voice, since
this was the first he had heard of Furneaux&#39;s
deliberate pilfering of the weapons from his colleague.</p>

<p class="indent">But something was singing in Clarke&#39;s ears, and
his eyes were glued on the blades resting there in
the drawer. Denial was impossible. He recognized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>[pg&nbsp;268]</span>
them instantly, and all his assurance fled from
that moment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, there!&quot; he murmured, in a curiously
broken voice. &quot;I give in! I&#39;m done! I&#39;m a baby
at this game. Next thing, I suppose, I&#39;ll be asked
to resign&mdash;me, who found &#39;em, and the diary,
and the letter telling Janoc not to kill her&mdash;yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was looking so fixedly at the two daggers that
he failed to see the smile of relief that flitted over
Winter&#39;s face. Now, more than ever, the Chief Inspector
realized that he was dealing with one of the
most complex and subtle crimes which had come
within his twenty years of experience. He was well
versed in Furneaux&#39;s sardonic humor, and the close
friendship that had existed between them ever since
the little Jersey man joined the Criminal Investigation
Department had alone stopped him from resenting
it. It was clear now to his quick intelligence
that Furneaux had actually planned nearly every
discovery which either he himself or Clarke had made.
Why? He could not answer. He was moving
through a fog, blind-folded, with hands tied behind
his back. Search where he would, he could not find
a motive, unless, indeed, Furneaux was impelled by
that strangest of all motives, a desire to convict
himself. At any rate, he did not want Clarke to
tread on the delicate ground that must now be covered
before Furneaux was arrested, and the happy
accident which had unlocked Clarke&#39;s tongue with regard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>[pg&nbsp;269]</span>
to the diary would serve admirably to keep
him well under control.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, look here, Inspector Clarke,&quot; said Winter
severely, after a pause that left the other in wretched
suspense, &quot;you have erred badly in this matter. For
once, I am willing to overlook it&mdash;because&mdash;because
you fancied you had a grievance. But, remember
this&mdash;never again! Lack of candor is fatal to the
best interests of the service. It is for me to decide
which cases you shall take up and which you shall
leave alone. You know perfectly well that if, by
chance, information reaches you with regard to any
inquiry which may prove useful to the man in charge
of it, it is your duty to tell him everything. I say
no more now. You understand me fully, I have no
doubt. You must take it from me, without question
or protest, that neither Janoc nor his sister was
responsible for that crime. They may have been
mixed up in it&mdash;in some manner now hidden from
me&mdash;but they had no share in it personally. Still,
seeing that you have worked so hard, I don&#39;t object
to your presence while I prove that I am right. Come
with me now to Marlborough Street. Mr. Osborne
must be set at liberty, of course, but I shall confront
your Anarchist friends with one another, and then
you will see for yourself my grounds for being so
positive as to their innocence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you yourself arrested Pauline, sir,&quot; Clarke
ventured to say.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t be an ass!&quot; was the cool rejoinder.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[pg&nbsp;270]</span>
&quot;Could I refuse to arrest her? Suppose you told
me now that you had killed the Frenchwoman,
wouldn&#39;t I be compelled to arrest <i>you</i>?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ha!&quot; laughed Clarke, in solemn mirth, &quot;what
about C. E. F.? Wouldn&#39;t it be funny if he owned
up to it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter answered not a word. He was busy locking
the drawer and rolling down the front of the
desk. But Clarke did not really mean what he had
said. His mind was dwelling on the inscrutable mystery
of the daggers which he had last held in his
hands in Soho and now knew to be reposing in a
locked desk in Scotland Yard.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Would you mind telling me, sir, how you managed
to get hold of &#39;em?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">Winter did not pretend ignorance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will be surprised to hear that I myself took
them, disinterred them, from the poor creature&#39;s
grave in Kensal Green Cemetery,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">Clarke&#39;s jaw dropped in the most abject amazement.
The thing had a supernatural sound. He
felt himself bewitched.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;From her grave?&quot; he repeated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But who put &#39;em there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah,&quot; said the other with a new note of sternness
in his voice, &quot;who but the murderer? But
come, we are wasting time&mdash;that unfortunate Osborne
must be half-demented. I suppose the Marlborough
Street people will let him out on my authority.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>[pg&nbsp;271]</span>
If not, I must get an order from the Commissioner.
By gad, there will be a fiendish rumpus
about this business before it is all settled!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Clarke shivered. He saw a certain well-belovd
detective inspector figuring prominently in that
&quot;rumpus,&quot; and he was in no mind to seek a new
career after passing the best part of his life in the
C. I. D.</p>

<p class="indent">But at Marlborough Street another shock awaited
the Chief. He and Clarke were entering the street
in a taxi when Furneaux crooked a finger at him
from the pavement. Winter could not, nay, he dared
not, ignore that demand for an interview.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stop here!&quot; he said to Clarke. Then he sprang
out, and approached Furneaux.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well?&quot; he snapped, &quot;have you made up your
mind to end this tragic farce?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not its chief buffoon,&quot; sneered Furneaux.
&quot;In fact, I am mainly a looker-on, but I do appreciate
its good points to the full.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter waved aside these absurdities.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have come to free Mr. Osborne,&quot; he said. &quot;I
was rather hoping that your own sense of fair dealing,
if you have any left&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Exactly what I thought,&quot; broke in the other.
&quot;That is why <i>I</i> am here. I hate correcting your
mistakes, because I fancy it does you good to discover
them for yourself. Still, it is a pity to
spoil a good cause. Mere professional pride forces
me to warn you against liberating Osborne.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>[pg&nbsp;272]</span>
&quot;Man alive, you try me beyond endurance. Do
you believe I don&#39;t know the truth&mdash;that Rose de
Bercy was your wife&mdash;that <i>you</i> were in that museum
before the murder&mdash;that <i>you</i>.... Oh, Furneaux,
you wring it from me. Get a pistol, man, before it
is too late.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You mean that?&quot; cried Furneaux, his eyes
gleaming with a new fire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Heaven knows I do!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You want to be my friend, then, after all?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Friend! If you realized half the torture&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pity!&quot; mused Furneaux aloud. &quot;Why didn&#39;t
you speak sooner? So you would rather I committed
suicide than be in your hands a prisoner?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter then awoke to the consciousness that this
extraordinary conversation was taking place in a
crowded thoroughfare, within a stone&#39;s throw of a
police-station in which lay three people charged with
having committed the very crime he was tacitly accusing
Furneaux of, while Clarke&#39;s ferret eyes must
be resting on them with a suspicion already half-formed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can say no more,&quot; he muttered gruffly. &quot;One
must forego friendship when duty bars the way.
But if you have a grain of humanity left in your
soul, come with me and release that unhappy young
man&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Some gush of emotion wrung Furneaux&#39;s face as
if with a spasm of physical pain. He held out his
right hand.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>[pg&nbsp;273]</span>
&quot;Winter, forgive me, I have misjudged you,&quot; he
said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it good-by?&quot; came the passionate question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, not good-by. It is an alliance, Winter, a
wiping of the slate. You don&#39;t understand, perhaps,
that we are both to blame. But you can take my
hand, old man. There is no stain of blood on it.
I did not murder my wife. I am her avenger, her
pitiless, implacable avenger&mdash;so pitiless, so implacable,
that I may have erred in my harshness. For
Heaven&#39;s sake, Winter, believe me, and take my
hand!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The man&#39;s magnetism was irresistible. Despite
the crushing weight of proof accumulated against
him, the claims of old friendship were not to be
ignored. Winter took the proffered hand and
squeezed it with a vehemence that not only showed
the tension of his feelings but also brought tears
of real anguish to Furneaux&#39;s eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I only asked you for a friendly grip, Winter,&quot;
he complained. &quot;You have been more than
kind. No matter what happens, don&#39;t offer to
shake hands with me again for twelve months at
least.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was no comprehending him, and Winter
abandoned the effort. Moreover, Clarke&#39;s puzzled
brows were bent on them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An alliance implies confidence,&quot; he said, and the
official mask fell on his bluff features. &quot;If you
can honestly&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>[pg&nbsp;274]</span>
Furneaux laughed, with just a faint touch
of that impish humor that the other knew so
well.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not Winter, but Didymus!&quot; he cried. &quot;Well,
then, let us proceed to the confounding of poor
Clarke. <i>Peste!</i> he deserves a better fate, for he has
worked like a Trojan. But leave Osborne to me.
Have no fear&mdash;I shall explain, a little to him, all
to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Clarke writhed with jealousy when Winter beckoned
to him. While his chief was paying the cabman,
he jeered at Furneaux.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I had a notion&mdash;&mdash;&quot; he began, but the other
caught his arm confidentially.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was just telling the guv&#39;nor how much we owe
to you in this Feldisham Mansions affair,&quot; he said.
&quot;You were on the right track all the time. You&#39;ve
the keenest nose in the Yard, Clarke. You can
smell an Anarchist through the stoutest wall ever
built. Now, not a word! You&#39;ll soon see how important
your investigations have been.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Clarke was overwhelmed by a new flood. Never
before had Furneaux praised him, unless in some
ironic phrase that galled the more because he did
not always extract its hidden meaning. He blinked
with astonishment.</p>

<p class="indent">With a newborn trust, which he would have failed
ignominiously to explain in words, Winter led his
colleagues to Marlborough Street police-station.
There, after a brief but earnest colloquy with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>[pg&nbsp;275]</span>
station inspector, he asked that Janoc and his sister
should be brought to the inspector&#39;s office.</p>

<p class="indent">Janoc came first, pale, languid, high-strung, but
evidently prepared to be led to his death that instant.</p>

<p class="indent">He looked at the four men, three in plain clothes
and one in uniform, with a superb air of dignity,
almost of superiority; in silence he awaited the inquisition
which he supposed he would be compelled to
undergo, but when no word was spoken&mdash;when even
that phantom of evil, Clarke, paid no heed to him,
he grew manifestly uneasy.</p>

<p class="indent">At last steps were heard, the door opened, and
Pauline Dessaulx entered. Of course, this brother
and sister were Gauls to the finger-tips. Each
screamed, each flew to the other&#39;s arms; they raved;
they wept, and laughed, and uttered incoherent words
of utmost affection.</p>

<p class="indent">Winter indulged them a few seconds. Then he
broke in on their transports.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, Janoc,&quot; he said brusquely, &quot;have done with
this acting! Why have you given the police so much
trouble?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Monsieur, I swear&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, have done with your swearing! Your sister
didn&#39;t kill Mademoiselle de Bercy. She wouldn&#39;t kill
a fly. Come, Pauline, own up!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Monsieur,&quot; faltered the girl, &quot;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You took the guilt on your shoulders in order
to shield your brother?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Wild-eyed, distraught, she looked from the face
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>[pg&nbsp;276]</span>
of the man who seemed to peer into her very soul
to that other face so dear to her. She knew not
what to say. Was this stern-visaged representative
of the law merely torturing her with a false hope?
Dared she say &quot;Yes,&quot; or must she persist in self-accusation?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Janoc,&quot; thundered Winter, &quot;you ought to be
ashamed of yourself. Don&#39;t you see how she is
suffering for your sake? Tell her, then, that you
are as innocent as she of this murder?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The dreamer, the man who would reform an evil
world by force, had the one great quality demanded
of a leader&mdash;he knew a man when he met him. He
turned now to Pauline.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My sister,&quot; he said in French, &quot;this gentleman
can be trusted. He is no trickster. I had no hand
in the slaying of the traitress, just though her death
might be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, <i>Dieu merci</i>!&quot; she breathed, and fainted.</p>

<p class="indent">The police matron was summoned, and the Frenchwoman
soon regained consciousness. Meanwhile,
Janoc admitted readily enough that he did really
believe in his sister&#39;s acceptance of the dread mission
imposed on her by the revolutionary party in Russia.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rose de Bercy was condemned, and my sweet
Pauline, alas! was deputed to be her executioner,&quot;
he said. &quot;We had waited long for the hour, and
the dagger was ready, though I, too, distrusted my
sister&#39;s courage. Then came an urgent letter from
St. Petersburg that the traitress was respited until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[pg&nbsp;277]</span>
a certain list found among her papers was
checked&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Found?&quot; questioned Winter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By Pauline,&quot; said Janoc.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, stolen?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Janoc brushed aside the substituted word as a
quibble.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Conceive my horror when I heard of the murder!&quot;
he cried with hands flung wide and eyes that
rolled. &quot;I was sure that Pauline had mistaken the
instructions&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where is the St. Petersburg letter?&quot; broke in
Furneaux.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sapristi! You will scarce credit. It was taken
from me by a man&mdash;a Russian agent he must have
been&mdash;one night in the Fraternal Club, Soho&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Clarke, produce it,&quot; said Furneaux, grinning.</p>

<p class="indent">Clarke flushed, grew white, nervously thumbed
some papers in a pocketbook, and handed to Winter
the letter which commenced: &quot;St. Petersburg says
...&quot; and ended: &quot;You will see to it that she to
whose hands vengeance has been intrusted shall fail
on the 3d.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter read, and frowned. Furneaux, too, read.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The 3d!&quot; he muttered. &quot;Just Heaven, what
a fatal date to her!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What was I to think?&quot; continued Janoc. &quot;Antonio
shared my view. He met Pauline at the Exhibition,
and was ready, if necessary, to vouch for
her presence there at the time Rose de Bercy went to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>[pg&nbsp;278]</span>
her reckoning; but he is not in the inner&mdash;he had
not heard of the Petersburg order.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yet he, and the rest of your gang, were prepared
to let Mr. Osborne hang for this crime,&quot; said
Winter, surveying the conspirator with a condemning
eye. But his menace or scorn was alike to Janoc,
who threw out his arms again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cré nom!&quot; he cried, &quot;why not? Is he not a rich
bourgeois like the rest? He and his class have
crushed us without mercy for many a century. What
matter if he were hanged by mistake? He could
be spared&mdash;my Pauline could not. He is merely a
rich one, my Pauline is a martyr to the cause!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Listen to me, Janoc,&quot; said Winter fiercely.
&quot;Spout what rubbish you please in your rotten club,
but if ever you dare again to plot&mdash;even to plot,
mind you&mdash;any sort of crime against life or property
in this free country, I shall crush you like
a beetle&mdash;like a beetle, do you hear, you wretched&mdash;insect!
Now, get out!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Monsieur, my sister?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wait outside there till she comes. Then leave
England, the pair of you, or you will try what hard
labor in a British prison can do for your theories.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Janoc bowed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Monsieur,&quot; he said, &quot;a prison has made me what
I am.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pauline was candid as her brother. She had, in
truth, misunderstood the respite given to her mistress,
and meant to kill her on the night of the 3d. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>[pg&nbsp;279]</span>
visit to the Exhibition was of her own contriving.
She had got rid of her English acquaintance, the
cook, very easily after meeting Antonio by appointment.
Then she left him, without giving a reason,
and hurried back to the mansions, where, owing to
her intimate knowledge of the internal arrangements,
she counted on entering and leaving the flat unseen.
She did actually succeed in her mission, but found
Rose de Bercy lying dead.</p>

<p class="indent">On the floor, close to the body, was a dagger,
and she had no doubt whatever that her brother had
acted in her stead, so she picked up the weapon, secreted
it with the dagger given her in readiness for
the crime, and took the first opportunity of hiding
herself, lest the mere fact that Janoc was seen in her
company should draw suspicion towards him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, but the lace? What of the piece of blood-stained
lace?&quot; demanded Furneaux.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wished to make sure, monsieur,&quot; was the
astounding reply. &quot;Had she not been dead, but
merely wounded, I&mdash;<i>Eh, bien!</i> I tore her dress open,
in order to feel if her heart was beating, and the bit
of lace remained in my hand. I was so excited that
I hardly knew what I was doing. I took it away.
Afterwards, when Antonio said that the police were
cooling in their chase of Osborne, I gave it to him;
he told me he could use it to good effect.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Phew!&quot; breathed Winter, &quot;you&#39;re a pretty lot
of cutthroats, I must say. Why did you keep the
daggers and the diary, sweet maid?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>[pg&nbsp;280]</span>
&quot;The knife that rid us of a traitress was sacred.
I thought the diary might be useful to the&mdash;to our
friends.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yet you gave it to Mr. Clarke without any
demur?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl shot a look at Clarke in which fright was
mingled with hatred.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&mdash;he&mdash;I was afraid of him,&quot; she stammered.</p>

<p class="indent">Winter opened the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is your brother,&quot; he said. &quot;Be off, both
of you. Take my advice and leave England to-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They went forth, hand in hand, in no wise cast
down by the loathing they had inspired. Clarke
looked far more miserable than they, for by their
going he had lost the prize of his life.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now for Osborne,&quot; whispered Furneaux. &quot;Leave
him to me, Winter. Trust me implicitly for five
minutes&mdash;that is all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Osborne was brought in by the station inspector,
that human ledger who would record without an unnecessary
word the name of the Prime Minister or
the Archbishop of Canterbury on any charge preferred
against either by a responsible member of the
force. The young American was calm now, completely
self-possessed, disdainful of any ignominy
that might be inflicted on him. He did not even
glance at Furneaux, but nodded to Winter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your assurances are seemingly of little value,&quot;
he said coldly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[pg&nbsp;281]</span>
&quot;Mr. Winter is quite blameless,&quot; snapped Furneaux,
obviously nettled by the implied reproof.
&quot;Please attend to me, Mr. Osborne&mdash;this affair rests
wholly between you and me. Learn now, for the
first time, I imagine, that Rose de Bercy was my wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Osborne did truly start at hearing that remarkable
statement. Clarke&#39;s mouth literally fell open;
even the uniformed inspector was stirred, and began
to pare a quill pen with a phenomenally sharp knife,
this being the only sign of excitement he had ever
been known to exhibit.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, unhappily for her and me, we were married
in Paris soon after she ran away from home,&quot; said
Furneaux. &quot;I&mdash;I thought&mdash;we should be happy.
She had rare qualities, Mr. Osborne; perhaps you
discovered some of them, and they fascinated you
as they fascinated me. But&mdash;she had others, which
<i>I</i> learnt to my sorrow, while <i>you</i> were spared. I
cannot explain further at this moment. I have only
to say that you are as free from the guilt of her
death&mdash;as <i>I</i> am!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter alone was conscious of a queer note in the
little man&#39;s voice as he dwelt on the comparison. He
seemed to be searching for some simile of wildest
improbability, and to have hit upon himself as supplying
it. But Osborne was in no mood for bewilderment.
He cared absolutely nothing about
present or future while the horrible past still held
the pall it had thrown on his prospects of bliss with
Rosalind.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[pg&nbsp;282]</span>
&quot;In that event, one might ask why I am here,&quot;
he said quietly. &quot;Not that I am concerned in the
solving of the riddle. You have done your worst,
Mr. Furneaux. You can inflict no deeper injury on
me. If you have any other vile purpose to serve
by telling me these things, by all means go right
ahead.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux&#39;s eyes glinted, and his wizened cheeks
showed some token of color, but he kept his voice
marvelously under control.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In time you will come to thank me, Mr. Osborne,&quot;
he said. &quot;To-day you are bitter, and I am not
surprised at it, but you could never have been happy
in your marriage with Miss Rosalind Marsh while
the shadow of suspicion clung to you. Please do
not forget that the world believes you killed Rose
de Bercy. If you walked forth now into Regent
Street, and the word went around that you were
there, a thousand people would mob you in a minute,
while ten thousand would be prepared to lynch you
within ten minutes. I have played with you, I admit&mdash;with
others, too, and now I am sorry&mdash;to a certain
extent. But in this case, I was at once detective,
and judge, and executioner. If you wantonly transferred
your love from the dead woman to the living
one, I cared not a straw what you suffered or how
heavily you were punished. That phase has passed.
To-day you have justified yourself. Within twenty-four
hours you will be free to marry Rosalind Marsh,
because your name will have lost the smirch now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>[pg&nbsp;283]</span>
placed on it, while your promise to Hylda Prout will
be dissolved. But for twenty-four hours you must
remain here, apparently a prisoner, in reality as
much at liberty as any man in London. Yes, I
vouch for my words&mdash;&mdash;&quot; for at last wonder and
hope were dawning in Osborne&#39;s eyes&mdash;&quot;my chief,
Mr. Winter, will tell you that I have never spoken
in this manner without making good what I have
said&mdash;never, I repeat. If I could spare you the
necessity of passing a night in a cell I would do
so; but I cannot. You are the decoy duck for the
wild creature that I mean to lay hands on before
another day has closed. Make yourself as comfortable
as possible&mdash;the inspector will see to that&mdash;but
I <i>must</i> keep you here, a prisoner in all outward semblance.
Are you willing?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For Heaven&#39;s sake&mdash;&mdash;&quot; began Osborne.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For Rosalind&#39;s sake, too,&quot; said Furneaux
gravely. &quot;No, I can answer no questions. She
has more to bear than you. She does not know
what to believe, whom to trust, whereas you have
my solemn assurance that all will soon be well with
both you and her. You see, I am not craving your
forgiveness&mdash;yet. It suffices that I have forgiven
<i>you</i>, since your tribulation will end quickly, whereas
mine remains for the rest of my days. I <i>did</i> love
Rose de Bercy: you did not.... Ah, bah! I am
growing sentimental. Winter, have you ever seen
me weep? No; then gag me if you hear me talking
in this strain again. Come, I have much to tell you.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>[pg&nbsp;284]</span>
Good-day, Mr. Osborne. The hours will soon fly;
by this time to-morrow you will be gay, light-hearted,
ready to shout your joy from the housetops&mdash;ready
even to admit that a detective may be bothered with
that useless incubus&mdash;a heart.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Osborne took a step towards him, but Furneaux
sprang out and banged the door. Winter caught
the millionaire by the shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am as thoroughly in the dark as you,&quot; he said.
&quot;Perhaps not, though. I have a glimmer of light;
you, too, will begin to see dimly when you have
collected your thoughts. But you must let Furneaux
have his way. It may not be your way&mdash;it
certainly is not mine&mdash;but he never fails when he
promises, and, at any rate, you must now be sure that
no manner of doubt rests in the minds of the police
where you are concerned. It is possible, after Furneaux
and I have gone into this thing fully, that you
may be released to-night&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Winter,&quot; cried Osborne, in whose veins the
blood was coursing tumultuously, &quot;let that strange
man justify his words concerning Miss Marsh, and
I shall remain here a month if that will help.&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br/>
WHEREIN TWO WOMEN TAKE THE FIELD</h2>

<p class="indent">Some tears, some tea, a bath, a change of clothing&mdash;where
is the woman who will not vie with the
Ph&oelig;nix under such conditions, especially if she be
sound in mind and limb? An hour after her arrival
at Porchester Gardens, Rosalind was herself again,
a somewhat pale and thin Rosalind, to be sure, but
each moment regaining vigor, each moment taking
huge strides back to the normal.</p>

<p class="indent">Of course, her ordered thoughts dwelt more and
more with Osborne, but with clear thinking came a
species of confusion that threatened to overwhelm her
anew in a mass of contradictions. If ever a man
loved a woman then Osborne loved her, yet she had
seen him in the arms of that dreadful creature, Hylda
Prout. If ever a man had shown devotion by word
and look, then Osborne was devoted to her, yet he
had taken leave of her with the manner of one who
was going to his doom. Ah, he spoke of &quot;a felon&#39;s
cell.&quot; Was that it? Was it true what the world
was saying&mdash;that he had really killed Rose de Bercy?
No, that infamy she would never believe. Yet Furneaux
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>[pg&nbsp;286]</span>
had arrested him&mdash;Furneaux, the strange little man
who seemed ever to say with his lip what
his heart did not credit.</p>

<p class="indent">During those weary hours in Poland Street, when
she was not dozing or faint with anxiety, she had
often recalled Furneaux&#39;s queer way of conducting
an inquiry. She knew little or nothing of police
methods, yet she was sure that British detectives did
not badger witnesses with denunciations of the suspected
person. In newspaper reports, too, she had
read of clever lawyers who defended those charged
with the commission of a crime; why, then, was Osborne
undefended; what had become of the solicitor
who appeared in his behalf at the inquest? Unfortunately,
she had no friend of ripe experience to
whom she could appeal in London, but she determined,
before that day closed, to seek those two, the
solicitor and Furneaux, bidding the one protect Osborne&#39;s
interests, and demanding of the other an explanation
of his gross failure to safeguard her when
she was actually carrying out his behests.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Marsh, far more feeble and unstrung than
her daughter, was greatly alarmed when Rosalind
announced her intention.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear one,&quot; she sobbed, &quot;I shall lose you
again. How can you dream of running fresh risk
of meeting those terrible beings who have already
wreaked their vengeance on you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, mother darling, you shall come with me&mdash;there
are lives at stake&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>[pg&nbsp;287]</span>
&quot;Of what avail are two women against creatures
like these Anarchists?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We shall go to Scotland Yard and obtain police
protection. Failing that, we shall hire men armed
with guns to act as our escort. Mother, I did not
die in that den of misery, but I shall die now of
impotent wrath if I remain here inactive and let Mr.
Osborne lie in prison for my sake.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For your sake? Rosalind? After what you
have told me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, it is true, true! I feel it here,&quot; and an
eager hand pressed close to her heart. &quot;My brain
says, &#39;You are foolish&mdash;why not believe your eyes,
your ears?&#39; but my heart bids me be up and doing,
for the night cometh when no man can work, and I
shall dream of death and the grave if I sleep this
day without striking one blow for the man that loves
me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yet he said&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bear with me, mother dear! I cannot explain,
I can only feel. A woman&#39;s intuition may sometimes
be trusted when logic points inexorably to the
exact opposite of her beliefs. And this is a matter
that calls for a woman&#39;s wit. See how inextricably
women are tangled in the net which has caught Osborne
in its meshes. A woman was killed, a woman
found the poor thing&#39;s body, a woman gave the worst
evidence against Osborne, a woman has sacrificed all
womanliness to snatch him from me. Ah, where is
Pauline Dessaulx? She, too, is mixed up in it. Has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>[pg&nbsp;288]</span>
she discovered the loss of the daggers? Has she
fled?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rosalind rose to her feet like one inspired, and
Mrs. Marsh, fearing for her reason, stammered
brokenly her willingness to go anywhere and do anything
that might relieve the strain. When her
daughter began to talk of &quot;daggers&quot; she was really
alarmed. The girl had alluded to them more than
once, but poor Mrs. Marsh&#39;s troubled brain associated
&quot;daggers&quot; with Anarchists. That any such
murderous-sounding weapons should be secreted in
a servant&#39;s bedroom at Porchester Gardens, be found
there by Rosalind, and carried by her all over London
in a cab, never entered her mind. Perhaps the
sight of Pauline would in itself have a soothing
effect, since one could not persist in such delusions
when the demure Frenchwoman, in the cap and apron
of respectable domestic service, came in answer to the
bell. So Mrs. Marsh rang: and another housemaid
appeared.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Please send Pauline here,&quot; said the white-faced
mother.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pauline is out, ma&#39;m,&quot; came the answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will she return soon?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know, ma&#39;m&mdash;I&mdash;I think she has run
away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Run away!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Two voices repeated those sinister words. To
Rosalind they brought a dim memory of something
said by Janoc, to Mrs. Marsh dismay. The three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>[pg&nbsp;289]</span>
were gazing blankly at each other when the clang of
a distant bell was heard.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s the front door,&quot; exclaimed the maid.
&quot;Perhaps Pauline has come back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She hurried away, and returned, breathless.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It isn&#39;t Pauline, ma&#39;m, but a lady to see Miss
Rosalind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What lady?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She wouldn&#39;t give a name, miss; she says she
wants to see you perticular.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Send her here.... Now, mother, don&#39;t be
alarmed. This is not Soho. If you wish it, I shall
get someone to wait in the hall until we learn our
mysterious visitor&#39;s business.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Most certainly, the well-dressed and elegant woman
whom the servant ushered into the room was not
of a type calculated to cause a pang of distrust
in any household in Porchester Gardens. She was
dressed quietly but expensively, and, notwithstanding
the heat of summer, so heavily veiled that her features
were not recognizable until she raised her veil.
Then a pair of golden-brown eyes flashed triumphantly
at the startled Rosalind, and Hylda Prout
said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;May I have a few words in private with you,
Miss Marsh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can have nothing to say to me that my
mother may not hear,&quot; said Rosalind curtly.</p>

<p class="indent">The visitor smiled, and looked graciously at Mrs.
Marsh.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>[pg&nbsp;290]</span>
&quot;Ah, I am pleased to have this opportunity of
meeting you,&quot; she said. &quot;You may have heard of
me. I am Hylda Prout.&quot; ... Then, seeing the
older woman&#39;s perplexity, she added: &quot;Since you do
not seem to know me by name, let me explain that
Mr. Rupert Osborne, of whom you must have heard a
good deal, is my promised husband.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Marsh might be ill and worried; but she was
a well-bred lady to the marrow, and she realized instantly
that the stranger&#39;s politeness covered a
studied insult to her daughter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Has Mr. Osborne sent you as his ambassador?&quot;
she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, he could not: he is in prison. But your
daughter and I have met under conditions that compel
me to ask her now not to interfere in the efforts
I shall make to secure his release.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Please go!&quot; broke in Rosalind, and she moved as
if to summon a servant.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not here from choice,&quot; sneered Hylda. &quot;I
have really come to plead for Mr. Osborne. If you
care for him as you say you do I want you to understand
two things: first, that your pursuit is in vain,
since he has given his word to marry me within a
week, and, secondly, that any further interference
in his affairs on your part may prove disastrous to
him. You cannot pretend that I have not warned
you. Had you taken my advice the other day,
Rupert would not now be under arrest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Marsh was sallow with indignation, but Rosalind,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>[pg&nbsp;291]</span>
though tingling in every fiber, controlled herself
sufficiently to utter a dignified protest.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You had something else in your mind than Mr.
Osborne&#39;s safety in coming here today: I do not
believe one word you have said,&quot; she cried.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, but you shall believe. Wait one short
week&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall not wait one short hour. Mr. Osborne&#39;s
arrest is a monstrous blunder, and I am going this
instant to demand his release.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He has not taken you into his confidence, it
would seem. Were it not for his promise to me
you would still be locked in your den at Poland
Street.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Some things may be purchased at a price so degrading
that a man pays and remains silent. If
Mr. Osborne won my liberty by the loss of his self-respect
I am truly sorry for him, but the fact, if it
is a fact, only strengthens my resolution to appeal
to the authorities in his behalf.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can achieve nothing, absolutely nothing,&quot;
shrilled Hylda vindictively.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall try to do much, and accomplish far more,
perhaps, than you imagine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will only succeed in injuring him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At any rate, I shall have obeyed the dictates of
my conscience, whereas your vile purposes have ever
been directed by malice. How dare you talk of
serving him! Since that poor woman was struck
dead by some unknown hand you have been his worst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>[pg&nbsp;292]</span>
enemy. In the guise of innocent friendship you
supplied the police with the only real evidence they
possess against him. Probably you are responsible
now for his arrest, which could not have happened
had I been at liberty during the past two days.
Go, and vent your spite as you will&mdash;no word of
yours can deter me from raising such a storm as
shall compel Mr. Osborne&#39;s release!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For a second or two those golden-brown eyes
blazed with a fire that might well have appalled
Rosalind could she have read its hidden significance.
During a tick of the clock she was in mortal peril
of her life, but Hylda Prout, though partially insane,
was not yet in that trance of the wounded tiger
which recks not of consequences so that it gluts its
rage.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Marsh, really frightened, rushed to the electric
bell, and the jar of its summons, faintly audible,
seemed to banish the grim specter that had entered
the room, though unseen by other eyes than those
of the woman who dreamed of death even while she
glowered at her rival. Her bitter tongue managed
to outstrip her murderous thoughts in the race back
to ordered thought.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are powerless,&quot; she taunted Rosalind, &quot;but,
like every other discarded lover, you cling to delusions.
Now I shall prove to you how my strength
compares with your weakness. You speak of appealing
to the authorities. That means Scotland Yard,
I suppose. Very well. I, too, shall go there, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>[pg&nbsp;293]</span>
your very company, if you choose, and it will
then be seen which of us two can best help Mr.
Osborne.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The housemaid appeared.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Please show this person out,&quot; said Rosalind.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My carriage is waiting&mdash;Rupert&#39;s carriage,&quot;
said Hylda.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;After she has gone, Lizzie,&quot; said Rosalind to
the maid, &quot;kindly get me a taxicab.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Porchester Gardens is well out to the west, so
the taxicab, entered in a fever of haste by Rosalind
and her mother, raced ahead of Osborne&#39;s bays in
the flight to Westminster. Hylda Prout had experienced
no difficulty in securing the use of the millionaire&#39;s
carriage. She went to his Mayfair flat,
paralyzed Jenkins by telling him of his master&#39;s
arrest, assured him, in the same breath, that she
alone could prove Osborne&#39;s innocence, and asked that
all the resources of the household should be placed
at her disposal, since Mr. Osborne meant to marry
her within a few days. Now, Jenkins had seen things
that brought this concluding statement inside the
bounds of credibility, so he became her willing slave
in all that concerned Osborne.</p>

<p class="indent">Winter was sitting in his office, with Furneaux
straddled across a chair in one corner, when Johnson,
the young policeman who was always at the Chief
Inspector&#39;s beck and call, entered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Two ladies to see you, sir,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux&#39;s eyes sparkled, but Winter took the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>[pg&nbsp;294]</span>
two cards and read: &quot;Mrs. Marsh; Miss Rosalind
Marsh.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bring them here,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I rather expected the other one first,&quot; grinned
Furneaux, who was now evidently on the best of
terms with his Chief.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps she won&#39;t show up. She must be deep,
crafty as a fox, or she could never have humbugged
me in the way you describe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear Winter, coincidence is the best dramatist
yet evolved. You were beaten by coincidence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you were not,&quot; and the complaint fell
querulously from the lips of one who was almost
unrivaled in the detection of crime.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You forget that <i>I</i> supplied the coincidence.
Clarke, too, blundered with positive genius. I assure
you that, in your shoes, I must have acted with&mdash;with
inconceivable folly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Winter grimly.</p>

<p class="indent">Rosalind and her mother came in. Both ladies
had been weeping, but the girl&#39;s eyes shone with
another light than that of tears when she cried vehemently:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are the responsible official here, I understand.
I have no word for <i>that</i> man,&quot; and she
transfixed Furneaux with a tragic finger, &quot;but I do
appeal to someone who may have a sense of decency&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have come to see me about Mr. Osborne?&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>[pg&nbsp;295]</span>
broke in Winter, for Rosalind&#39;s utterance was choked
by a sob.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, of course. Are you aware&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am aware of everything, Miss Marsh. Please
be seated; and you, too, Mrs. Marsh. Mr. Osborne
is in no danger whatsoever. I cannot explain, but
you must trust the police in this matter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, so <i>he</i> said,&quot; and Rosalind shot a fiery glance
at the unabashed Furneaux.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Seen anybody?&quot; he asked, with an amiable
smirk.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Has anybody been gloating over Mr. Osborne&#39;s
arrest?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For the life of her, Rosalind could not conceal
the surprise caused by this question. She even
smothered her resentment in her eagerness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Osborne&#39;s typist, a woman named Hylda
Prout, has been to see me,&quot; she cried.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Excellent! What did she say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Everything that a mean heart could suggest.
But you will soon hear her statements. She is coming
here herself, or, at least, so she said.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Great Scott!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux sprang up, and ran to the bell. For
some reason which neither Mrs. Marsh nor her daughter
could fathom, the mercurial little Jersey man was
wild with excitement; even Winter seemed to be disturbed
beyond expression. Johnson came, and Furneaux
literally leaped at him.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>[pg&nbsp;296]</span>
&quot;Ring up that number, quick! You know exactly
what to say&mdash;and do!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Johnson saluted and vanished again; Winter had
chosen him for his special duties because he never
uttered a needless word. Still, these tokens of activity
in the police headquarters did not long repress
the tumult in Rosalind&#39;s breast.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If, as you tell me, Mr. Osborne is in no danger&mdash;&mdash;&quot;
she began; but Winter held up an impressive
hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are here in order to help him,&quot; he said
gravely. &quot;Pray believe that we appreciate your
feelings most fully. If this girl, Hylda Prout, is
really on her way here we have not a moment to
lose. No more appeals, I beg of you, Miss Marsh.
Tell us every word that passed between you and
her. You can speak all the more frankly if I assure
you that Mr. Furneaux, my colleague, has acted
throughout in Mr. Osborne&#39;s interests. Were it not
for him this young gentleman, who, I understand,
will soon become your husband, would never have
been cleared of the stigma of a dreadful crime....
No, pardon me, not a syllable on that subject....
What did Hylda Prout say? Why is she coming to
Scotland Yard?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Impressed in spite of herself, Rosalind gave a
literal account of the interview at Porchester Gardens.
She was burning to deliver her soul on matters
that appeared to be so much more important,
such as the finding and loss of the daggers, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>[pg&nbsp;297]</span>
strange behavior of Pauline Dessaulx, the statement,
now fiery bright in her mind, made by Janoc when
he spoke of his sister&#39;s guilt&mdash;but, somehow, the tense
interest displayed by the two detectives in Hylda
Prout&#39;s assertions overbore all else, and Rosalind
proved herself a splendid witness, one able to interpret
moods and glances as well as to record the
spoken word.</p>

<p class="indent">Even while she spoke a lurid fancy flashed through
her brain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, gracious Heaven!&quot; she cried. &quot;Can it
be&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter rose and placed a hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have endured much, Miss Marsh,&quot; he said
in a voice of grave sympathy. &quot;Now, I trust to
your intelligence and power of self-command. No
matter what suspicions you may have formed, you
must hide them. Possibly, Mr. Furneaux or I may
speak or act within the next half-hour in a manner
that you deem prejudicial to Mr. Osborne. I want
you to express your resentment in any way you may
determine, short of leaving us. Do you understand?
We shall act as on the stage; you must do the same.
You need no cue from us. Defend Mr. Osborne;
urge his innocence; threaten us with pains and penalties;
do anything, in short, that will goad Hylda
Prout into action in his behalf for fear lest you may
prevail where she has failed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A knock was heard at the door. He sank back
into his seat.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>[pg&nbsp;298]</span>
&quot;Do you promise?&quot; he muttered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; she breathed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come in!&quot; cried Winter, and the imperturbable
Johnson ushered in Hylda Prout. Even in the storm
and stress of contending emotions Rosalind knew
that there was a vital difference between the reception
accorded to the newcomer and that given to her
mother and herself. They had been announced, their
names scrutinized in advance, as it were, whereas
Hylda Prout&#39;s arrival was expected, provided for;
in a word, the policeman on guard had his orders
and was obeying them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, this <i>is</i> a surprise, Miss Prout,&quot; exclaimed
Furneaux before anyone else could utter a word.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it?&quot; she asked, smiling scornfully at Rosalind.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite. Miss Marsh told us, of course, of your
visit, and I suppose that your appearance here is
inspired by the same motive as hers. My chief, Mr.
Winter, has just been telling her that the law brooks
no interference, yet she persists in demanding Mr.
Osborne&#39;s release. She cannot succeed in obtaining
it, unless she brings a positive order from the Home
Secretary&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall get it,&quot; vowed Rosalind, to whom it seemed
that Furneaux&#39;s dropped voice carried a subtle hint.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Try, by all means,&quot; said Furneaux blandly.
&quot;Nevertheless, I strongly advise you ladies, all three,
to go home and let matters take their course.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never!&quot; cried Rosalind valiantly. &quot;You must
either free Mr. Osborne to-night or I drive straight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>[pg&nbsp;299]</span>
from this office to the House of Commons. I have
friends there who will secure me a hearing by the
Home Secretary.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux glanced inquiringly at Winter, whose
hand was stroking his chin as if in doubt. Hylda
Prout took a step nearer the Chief Inspector. Her
dress brushed against the drawer which contained
the daggers, and one of those grewsome blades had
pierced Rose de Bercy&#39;s brain through the eye.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Home Secretary is merely an official like the
rest of you,&quot; she said bitingly. &quot;Miss Marsh may
appeal to whom she thinks fit, but the charge against
Mr. Osborne will keep him in custody until it is heard
by a magistrate. Nothing can prevent that&mdash;nothing&mdash;unless&mdash;&mdash;&quot;
and her gaze dwelt warily on Furneaux
for a fraction of an instant&mdash;&quot;unless the
police themselves are convinced that the evidence on
which they rely is so flimsy that they run the risk
of public ridicule by bringing it forward.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ha! ha!&quot; laughed Furneaux knowingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think I am wasting time here,&quot; cried Rosalind,
half rising.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One moment, I pray you,&quot; put in Winter.
&quot;There is some force in Miss Prout&#39;s remarks, but
I am betraying no secret in saying that Mr. Osborne&#39;s
apparently unshakable alibi can be upset, while we
have the positive identification of at least three people
who saw him on the night of the crime.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Meaning the housekeeper, the driver of the taxicab,
and the housemaid at Feldisham Mansions?&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>[pg&nbsp;300]</span>
said Hylda coolly, and quite ignoring Rosalind&#39;s outburst.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At least those,&quot; admitted Winter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are there others, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Really, Miss Prout, this is most irregular. We
are not trying Mr. Osborne in this room.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see there is nothing for it but to carry my
plea for justice to the Home Secretary,&quot; cried Rosalind,
acting as she thought best in obedience to a
lightning glance from Furneaux. &quot;Come, mother,
we shall soon prove to these legal-minded persons that
they cannot juggle away a man&#39;s liberty to gratify
their pride&mdash;and spite.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hylda&#39;s eyes took fire at that last word.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go to your Home Secretary,&quot; she said with
measured venom. &quot;Much good may it do you!
While <i>you</i> are being dismissed with platitudes <i>I</i> shall
have rescued my affianced husband from jail.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear me! this is most embarrassing. Your affianced
husband?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Furneaux cackled out each sentence, and looked
alternately at Hylda and Rosalind. There was no
mistaking his meaning. He implied that the one
woman was callously appropriating a man who was
the acknowledged suitor of the other.</p>

<p class="indent">Hylda laughed shrilly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is news to you, Mr. Furneaux,&quot; she cried.
&quot;Yet I thought you were so clever as to be almost
omniscient. Come now with me, and I shall prove
to you that the so-called identification of Mr. Osborne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>[pg&nbsp;301]</span>
by Hester Bates and Campbell, the chauffeur,
is a myth. The hysterical housemaid I leave to
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter leaned back in his chair and waved an expostulating
hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Pon my honor, this would be amusing if it were
not so terribly serious for Osborne,&quot; he vowed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If that is all, I prefer to depend on the Home
Secretary,&quot; said Rosalind.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let her go,&quot; purred Hylda contemptuously. &quot;I
can make good my boast, but she cannot.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Boasting is of no avail in defeating a charge
of murder,&quot; said Furneaux. &quot;Before we even begin
to take you seriously, Miss Prout, we must know
what you actually mean by your words.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I mean this&mdash;that I, myself, will appear before
Hester Bates in such guise that she will swear it was
me, and not Mr. Osborne, whom she saw on the stairs
that night. If that does not suffice, I shall meet
Campbell at the corner of Berkeley Street, if you can
arrange for his presence there, and tell him to drive
me to Feldisham Mansions, and he will swear that it
was I, and not Mr. Osborne, who gave him that same
order on the night of the third of July. Surely,
if I accomplish so much, you will set Rupert at liberty.
Believe me, I am not afraid that you will
commit the crowning blunder of arresting <i>me</i> for the
murder, after having arrested Janoc, and his sister,
<i>and</i> Rupert.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter positively started. So did Furneaux.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>[pg&nbsp;302]</span>
Evidently they were perturbed by the extent of her
information. Hylda saw the concern depicted on
their faces; she laughed low, musically, full-throated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, is it a bargain?&quot; she taunted them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course&mdash;&mdash;&quot; began Winter, and stopped.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is no denying the weakness of our position
if you can do all that,&quot; said Furneaux suavely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pray do not let me detain you from visiting the
House of Commons,&quot; murmured Hylda to Rosalind.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps, in the circumstances, you had better
wait till to-morrow,&quot; said Winter, rising and looking
hard at Rosalind.</p>

<p class="indent">This man had won her confidence, and she felt that
she was in the presence of a tragedy, yet it was hard
to yield in the presence of her rival. Tears filled
her eyes, and she bowed her head to conceal them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come, mother,&quot; she said brokenly. &quot;We are
powerless here, it would seem.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Allow me to show you the way out,&quot; said Winter,
and he bustled forward.</p>

<p class="indent">In the corridor, when the door was closed, he
caught an arm of each and bent in a whisper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Furneaux was sure she would try some desperate
move,&quot; he breathed. &quot;Rest content now, Miss
Marsh. If all goes well, your ill-used friend will
be with you to-night. Treat him well. He deserves
it. He did not open your letter. He sacrificed
himself in every way for your sake. He even promised
to marry that woman, that arch-fiend, in order
to rescue you from Janoc. So, believe him, for he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>[pg&nbsp;303]</span>
is a true man, the soul of honor, and tell him from
me that he owes some share of the restitution of his
good name in the eyes of the public to your splendid
devotion during the past few minutes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Not often did the Chief Inspector unbend in this
fashion. There was no ambiguity in his advice. He
meant what he said, and said it so convincingly that
Rosalind was radiantly hopeful when she drove away
with her mother.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br/>
THE CLOSING SCENE</h2>

<p class="indent">It was a scared and worried-looking Jenkins who
admitted Hylda Prout and the two detectives to Osborne&#39;s
flat in Clarges Street, Mayfair. These comings
and goings of police officers were disconcerting,
to put it mildly, and an event had happened but a
few minutes earlier which had sorely ruffled his
usually placid acceptance of life as it presented itself.
Still, the one dominant thought in his mind
was anxiety in his master&#39;s behalf, and, faithful to its
promptings, he behaved like an automaton.</p>

<p class="indent">Hylda carried herself with the regal air of one
who was virtual mistress of the house. She had invited
the two men to share her carriage, and there
was an assured authority in her voice when she now
directed the gray-headed butler to show them into
the library while she went upstairs to Mr. Osborne&#39;s
dressing-room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And, by the way, Jenkins,&quot; she added, &quot;tell
Mrs. Bates to come to these gentlemen. They wish
to ask her a few questions.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, bring Mrs. Bates,&quot; said Furneaux softly.
&quot;Don&#39;t let her come alone. She might be frightened,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>[pg&nbsp;305]</span>
and snivel, being a believer in ghosts, whereas we wish
her to remain calm.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jenkins thought he understood, but said nothing.
Hylda Prout sped lightly up the stairs, and when
Jenkins came with the housekeeper, Furneaux crept
close to him, pointed to a screened doorway leading
to the kitchen quarters, and murmured the one word:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At once he turned to Mrs. Bates and engaged her
in animated chatter, going so far as to warn her that
the police were trying an experiment which might
definitely set at rest all doubts as to Mr. Osborne&#39;s
innocence, so she must be prepared to see someone
descend the stairs who might greatly resemble the
person she saw ascending them on the night of the
murder.</p>

<p class="indent">The maisonette rented by the young millionaire
was not constructed on the lines associated with the
modern self-contained flat. It consisted of the
ground floor, and first story of a mid-Victorian
mansion, while the kitchen was in a basement. As it
happened to be the property of a peer who lived next
door&mdash;a sociable person who entertained largely&mdash;these
lower stories were completely shut off from the
three upper ones, which were thrown into the neighboring
house, thus supplying the landlord with
several bedrooms and bathrooms that Osborne did
not need. As a consequence, the entrance hall and
main staircase were spacious, and the staircase in
particular was elaborate, climbing to a transverse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>[pg&nbsp;306]</span>
corridor in two fine flights, of which the lower one
sprang from the center of the hall and the upper led
at a right angle from a broad half-landing.</p>

<p class="indent">Anyone coming down this upper half of the stairs
could be seen full face from the screened door used
by the servants: but when descending the lower half,
the view from the same point would be in profile.</p>

<p class="indent">At present, however, the curtains were drawn
tightly across the passage, and the only occupants
of the hall and library were the two detectives, Jenkins,
and Mrs. Bates.</p>

<p class="indent">Hylda Prout did not hurry. If she were engaged
in a masquerade which should achieve its object she
evidently meant to leave nothing to chance, and a
woman cannot exchange her costume for a man&#39;s
without experiencing difficulty with her hair, especially
when she is endowed by nature with a magnificent
chevelure.</p>

<p class="indent">Jenkins returned from the mission imposed by Furneaux&#39;s
monosyllable,&mdash;insensibly the four deserted
the brilliantly lighted library and gathered in the
somewhat somber hall, whose old oak wainscoting and
Grinling Gibbons fireplace forbade the use of garish
lamps. Insensibly, too, their voices lowered. The
butler and housekeeper hardly knew what to expect,
and were creepy and ill at ease, but the two police
officers realized that they were about to witness a
scene of unparalleled effrontery, which, in its outcome,
might have results vastly different from those
anticipated.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>[pg&nbsp;307]</span>
They were sure now that Hylda Prout had killed
Rose de Bercy. Furneaux had known that terrible
fact since his first meeting with Osborne&#39;s secretary,
whereas Winter had only begun to surmise it when
he and Furneaux were reconciled on the very threshold
of Marlborough Street police-station. Now
he was as certain of it as Furneaux. Page by page,
chapter by chapter, his colleague had unfolded a
most convincing theory of the crime. But theories
will not suffice for a judge and jury&mdash;there must be
circumstantial evidence as well&mdash;and not only was
such evidence scanty as against Hylda Prout, but
it existed in piles against Osborne, against Pauline
Dessaulx, and against Furneaux himself. Indeed,
Winter had been compelled to recall his permission
to Janoc and his sister to leave England that day.
He foresaw that Hylda Prout, if brought to trial,
would use her knowledge of Rose de Bercy&#39;s dealings
with the Anarchist movement to throw the gravest
suspicion on its votaries in London, and it would
require no great expert in criminal law to break up
the theoretical case put forward by the police by
demonstrating the circumstantial one that existed in
regard to Pauline Dessaulx.</p>

<p class="indent">This line of defense, already strong, would become
impregnable if neither Janoc nor Pauline were forthcoming
as witnesses. So Clarke, greatly to his delight,
was told off again to supervise their movements,
after they had been warned not to quit Soho
until Winter gave them his written permission.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>[pg&nbsp;308]</span>
Some of the difficulties ahead, a whole troupe of
fantastic imageries from the past, crowded in on
Winter&#39;s mind as he stood there in the hall with
Furneaux. What a story it would make if published
as he could tell it! What a romance! It
began eight years ago at a <i>fête champtre</i> in Jersey.
Then came a brief delirium of wedded life for Furneaux,
followed by his wife&#39;s flight and reappearance
as a notable actress. Osborne came on the
scene, and quickly fell a victim to her beauty and
charm of manner. It was only when marriage was
spoken of that Furneaux decided to interfere, and
he had actually gone to Osborne&#39;s residence in order
to tell him the truth as to his promised wife on the
very day she was killed. Failing to meet him, after
a long wait in the library and museum, during which
he had noted the absence of both the Saracen dagger
and the celt, already purloined for their dread purposes,
he had gone to Feldisham Mansions.</p>

<p class="indent">During a heart-breaking scene with his wife he
had forced from her a solemn promise to tell Osborne
why she could not marry him, and then to leave
England. The unhappy woman was writing the last
word in her diary when Furneaux was announced!
No wonder she canceled an engagement for dinner
and the theater. She was sick at heart. A vain
creature, the wealth and position she craved for had
been snatched from her grasp on the very moment
they seemed most sure.</p>

<p class="indent">The murder followed his departure within half an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>[pg&nbsp;309]</span>
hour. Planned and executed by a woman whom none
would dream of, it was almost worthy to figure as
the crime of the century. Hylda Prout had counted
on no other suspect than the man she loved. She
knew he was safe&mdash;she assured herself, in the first
place, that he could offer the most positive proof
of his innocence&mdash;but she reckoned on popular indignation
alleging his guilt, while she alone would
stand by him through every pang of obloquy and
despair. She was well prepared, guarded from every
risk. Her open-hearted employer had no secrets
from her. She meant to imperil him, to cast him
into the furnace, and pluck him forth to her own
arms.</p>

<p class="indent">But fate could plot more deviously and strangely
than Hylda Prout. It could bring about the meeting
of Osborne and Rosalind, the mutual despair
and self-sacrifice of Janoc and Pauline, the insensate
quarrel between Winter and Furneaux, and the jealous
prying of Clarke, while scene after scene of
tragic force unfolded itself at Tormouth, in the Fraternal
Club, in the dismal cemetery, in Porchester
Gardens, and in the dens of Soho.</p>

<p class="indent">Winter sighed deeply at the marvel of it all, and
Furneaux heard him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She will be here soon,&quot; he said coolly. &quot;She is
just putting on Osborne&#39;s boots.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter started at the apparent callousness of the
man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is rather Frenchified,&quot; he whispered. &quot;Reminds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>[pg&nbsp;310]</span>
one of the &#39;reconstructed crime&#39; method of
the <i>juge d&#39;instruction</i>. I wish we had more good,
sound, British evidence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is nothing good, or sound, or British about
this affair,&quot; said Furneaux. &quot;It is French from
beginning to end&mdash;a passionate crime as they say&mdash;but
I shall be glad when it is ended, and I am free.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Free?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. When she is safely dealt with,&quot; and he
nodded in the direction of the dressing-room, &quot;I shall
resign, clear off, betake my whims and my weaknesses
to some other clime.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t be an ass, Furneaux!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can&#39;t help it, dear boy. I&#39;m a bit French, too,
you know. No Englishman could have hounded
down Osborne as I have done, merely to gratify my
own notions of what was due to the memory of my
dead wife. And I have played with this maniac
upstairs as a cat plays with a mouse. I wouldn&#39;t
have done that, though, if she hadn&#39;t smashed Mirabel&#39;s
face. She ought to have spared that. Therein
she was a tiger rather than a woman. Poor Mirabel!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Not Rose, but Mirabel! His thoughts had bridged
the years. He murmured the words in a curiously
unemotional tone, but Winter was no longer deceived.
It would be many a day, if ever, before Furneaux
became his cheery, impish, mercurial self again.</p>

<p class="indent">And now there was an opening of a door, and
Winter shot one warning glance at the curtains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>[pg&nbsp;311]</span>
which shrouded the passage to the kitchen. A man&#39;s
figure appeared beyond the rails of the upper landing,
a man attired in a gray frock-coat suit and
wearing a silk hat. Mrs. Bates uttered a slight
scream.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I never!&quot; she squeaked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you did, once,&quot; urged Furneaux, instantly
alert. &quot;You see now that you might be mistaken
when you said you saw Mr. Osborne on that evening?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, sir; if that is Miss Prout she&#39;s the very
image&mdash;&mdash;Now, who would have believed it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You did,&quot; prompted Furneaux again. &quot;But
this time you must be more careful. Tell us now
who it was you saw on the stair, your master, or
his secretary made up to represent him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Bates began to cry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wouldn&#39;t have said such a thing for a mint of
money, sir. It was cruel to deceive a poor woman
so, real cruel I call it. Of course, it was Miss Prout
I saw. Well, there! What a horrid creature to
behave in that way&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No comments, please,&quot; said Furneaux sternly.</p>

<p class="indent">Throughout he was gazing at Hylda Prout with
eyes that scintillated. She was standing now on
the half-landing, and her face had lost some of its
striking semblance to Osborne&#39;s because of the expression
of mocking triumph that gleamed through
its make-up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That will do, thank you, Miss Prout,&quot; he said.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>[pg&nbsp;312]</span>
&quot;Now, will you kindly walk slowly up again, reeling
somewhat, as if you were on the verge of collapse
after undergoing a tremendous strain?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A choked cry, or groan, followed by a scuffle, came
from the curtained doorway, and Hylda turned
sharply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is there?&quot; she demanded, in a sort of quick
alarm that contrasted oddly with her previous air of
complete self-assurance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jenkins,&quot; growled Winter, &quot;just go there and
see that none of the servants are peeping. That
door should have been closed. Slam it now!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The butler hurried with steps that creaked on
the parquet floor. Hylda leaned over the balusters
and watched him. He fumbled with the curtains.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is all right, sir,&quot; he said thickly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Some one is there,&quot; she cried. &quot;Who is it?
I am not here to be made a show of, even to please
some stupid policemen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter strode noisily across the hall, talking the
while, vowing official vengeance on eavesdroppers.
He, too, reached the doorway, glanced within, and
drew back the curtains.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Some kitchen-maid, I suppose,&quot; he said off-handedly.
&quot;Anyhow, she has run away. You need
not wait any longer, Miss Prout. Kindly change
your clothing as quickly as possible and come with
us. You have beaten us. Mr. Osborne must be
released forthwith.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>[pg&nbsp;313]</span>
Her sudden spasm of fear was dispelled by hearing
that promise. She forgot to &quot;reel&quot; as she
ran upstairs, but Furneaux did not remind her. He
exchanged glances with Winter, and the latter motioned
Jenkins to take Mrs. Bates to her own part
of the establishment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At Vine Street, I think,&quot; muttered Winter in
Furneaux&#39;s ear.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, here, I insist; we must strike now. She must
realize that we have a case. Give her time to gather
her energies and we shall never secure a conviction.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter loathed the necessity of terrifying a
woman, but he yielded, since he saw no help for it.
This time they had not long to wait. Soon they
heard a rapid, confident tread on the stairs, and
Hylda Prout was with them in the library. Both
men, who had been seated, rose when she entered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; she said jauntily, &quot;are you convinced?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fully,&quot; said Winter.</p>

<p class="indent">She turned to Furneaux.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you, little man, what do <i>you</i> say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have never needed to be convinced,&quot; he answered.
&quot;I have known the truth since the day
when we first met.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Something in his manner seemed to trouble her,
but those golden brown eyes dwelt on him in a species
of scornful surprise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, then, have you liberated Janoc and his
sister?&quot; she demanded.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>[pg&nbsp;314]</span>
&quot;Because they are innocent.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She laughed, a nervous, unmirthful laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But there only remains Mr. Osborne,&quot; she protested.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is one other, the murderess,&quot; he said.
Even while she gazed at him in wonder he had come
quite near. His right hand shot out and grasped
her arm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I arrest you, Hylda Prout,&quot; he said. &quot;I charge
you with the murder of Mirabel Furneaux, otherwise
known as Rose de Bercy, at Feldisham Mansions,
on the night of July 3d.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She looked at him in a panic to which she tried
vainly to give a semblance of incredulity. Even in
that moment of terror a new thought throbbed in her
dazed brain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mirabel Furneaux!&quot; she managed to gasp.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, my wife. You committed a needless crime,
Hylda Prout. She had never done, nor ever could
have done, you any injury. But it is my duty to
warn you that everything you now say will be taken
down in writing, and may be used in evidence against
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She tried to wrest herself free, but his fingers
clung to her like a steel trap. Winter, too, approached,
as if to show the folly of resistance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let go my arm!&quot; she shrieked, and her eyes
blazed redly though the color had fled from her
cheeks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot. I dare not,&quot; said Furneaux. &quot;I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>[pg&nbsp;315]</span>
have reason to believe that you carry a weapon, perhaps
poison, concealed in your clothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Idiot!&quot; she screamed, now beside herself with
rage, &quot;what evidence can you produce against me?
You will be the laughing stock of London, you and
your arrests.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Bates knows now who it was she saw on
the stairs,&quot; said Furneaux patiently. &quot;Campbell,
the driver of the taxicab, has recognized you as the
person he drove to and from Feldisham Mansions.
Mary Dean, the housemaid there, can say at last why
she fancied that Mr. Osborne killed her mistress.
But you&#39;ll hear these things in due course. At
present you must come with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where to?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To Vine Street police-station.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall I not be permitted to see Rupert?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A tremor convulsed her lithe body. Then, and
not till then, did she really understand that the apparently
impossible had happened. Still, her extraordinary
power of self-reliance came to her aid.
She ceased to struggle, and appealed to Winter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This man is acting like a lunatic,&quot; she cried.
&quot;He says his wife was killed, and if that be true
he is no fit person to conduct an inquiry into the
innocence or guilt of those on whom he wreaks his
vengeance. You know why I came here to-night&mdash;merely
to prove how you had blundered in the past&mdash;yet
you dare to turn my harmless acting into a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>[pg&nbsp;316]</span>
justification of my arrest. Where are these people,
Campbell and the woman, whose testimony you bring
against me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Now, in putting that impassioned question, she
was wiser than she knew. Furneaux was ever ready
to take risks in applying criminal procedure that
Winter fought shy of. He had seen more than one
human vampire slip from his grasp because of some
alleged unfairness on the part of the police, of which
a clever counsel had made ingenious use during the
defense. If Hylda Prout had been identified by
others than Mrs. Bates, of whose presence alone she
was aware, she had every right to be confronted
with them. He turned aside and told the horrified
Jenkins to bring the witnesses from the room in
which they had taken refuge. As a matter of fact,
Campbell and Mary Dean, in charge of Police Constable
Johnson, had been concealed behind the curtains
that draped the servants&#39; passage, and Johnson
had scarce been able to stifle the scream that
rose to the housemaid&#39;s lips when she saw on the
stairs the living embodiment of her mistress&#39;s murderer.</p>

<p class="indent">But Furneaux did not mean to allow Hylda Prout
to regain the marvelous self-possession which had
been imperiled by the events of the past minute.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;While we are waiting for Campbell and the girl
you may as well learn the really material thing that
condemns you,&quot; he said, whispering in her ear with
quiet menace. &quot;You ought to have destroyed that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>[pg&nbsp;317]</span>
gray suit which you purchased from a second-hand
clothes dealer. It was a deadly mistake to keep
those blood-stained garments. The clothes Osborne
wore have been produced long since. They were
soiled by you two days after the murder, a fact which
I can prove by half a dozen witnesses. Those which
you wore to-night, <i>which you are wearing now</i>, are
spotted with your victim&#39;s blood. I know, because
I have seen them in your lodgings, and they can be
identified beyond dispute by the man who sold them
to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly he raised his voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Winter! Quick! She has the strength of ten
women!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For Hylda Prout, hearing those fateful words,
was seized with a fury of despair. She had peered
into Furneaux&#39;s eyes and seen there the pitiless purpose
which had filled his every waking moment since
his wife&#39;s untimely death. Love and hate had conspired
to wreck her life. They had mastered her
at last. From being their votary she had become
their victim. An agonizing sigh came from her
straining breast. She was fighting like a catamount,
while Winter held her shoulders and Furneaux her
wrists; then she collapsed between them, and a thin
red stream issued from her lips.</p>

<p class="indent">They carried her to the sofa on which she had lain
when for the first and only time in her life those same
red lips had met Rupert Osborne&#39;s.</p>

<p class="indent">Winter hurried to the door, and sent Campbell,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>[pg&nbsp;318]</span>
coming on tiptoe across the hall, flying in his taxi
for a doctor. But Furneaux did not move from her
side. He gazed down at her with something of the
judge, something of the executioner, in his waxen
features.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All heart!&quot; he muttered, &quot;all heart, controlled
by a warped brain!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She has broken a blood vessel,&quot; said Winter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; she has broken her heart,&quot; said Furneaux,
hearing, though apparently not heeding
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A physical impossibility,&quot; growled the Chief Inspector,
to whom the sight of a woman&#39;s suffering
was peculiarly distressing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Her heart has dilated beyond belief. It is twice
the normal size. This is the end, Winter! She is
dying!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The flow of blood stopped abruptly. She opened
her eyes, those magnificent eyes which were no longer
golden brown but a pathetic yellow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, forgive!&quot; she muttered. &quot;I&mdash;I&mdash;loved
you, Rupert&mdash;with all my soul!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She seemed to sink a little, to shrink, to pass from
a struggle to peace. The lines of despair fled from
her face. She lay there in white beauty, a lily
whiteness but little marred by traces of the make-up
hurriedly wiped off her cheeks and forehead.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;May the Lord be merciful to her!&quot; said Furneaux,
and without another word, he hurried from
the room and out of the house.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>[pg&nbsp;319]</span>
Winter, having secured some degree of order in a
distracted household, raced off to Marlborough
Street; but Furneaux had been there before him, and
Osborne, knowing nothing of Hylda Prout&#39;s death,
had flown to Porchester Gardens and Rosalind.</p>

<p class="indent">The hour was not so late that the thousand eyes
of Scotland Yard could not search every nook in
which Furneaux might have taken refuge, but in
vain. Winter, grieving for his friend, fearing the
worst, remained all night in his office, receiving reports
of failure by telephone and messenger. At
last, when the sun rose, he went wearily to his home,
and was lying, fully dressed, on his bed, in the state
of half-sleep, half-exhaustion, which is nature&#39;s way
of healing the bruised spirit, when he seemed to hear
Furneaux&#39;s voice sobbing:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My Mirabel, why did you leave me, you whom
I loved!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Instantly he sprang up in a frenzy of action, and
ran out into the street. At that early hour, soon
after six o&#39;clock, there was no vehicle to be found
except a battered cab which had prowled London
during the night, but he woke the heavy-witted driver
with a promise of double fare, and the horse ambled
over the slow miles to the yews and laurels of Kensal
Green Cemetery.</p>

<p class="indent">There he found him, kneeling by the side of that
one little mound of earth, after having walked in
solitude through the long hours till the gates were
opened for the day&#39;s digging of graves. Winter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>[pg&nbsp;320]</span>
said nothing. He led his friend away, and had him
cared for.</p>

<p class="indent">Slowly the cloud lifted. At last, when a heedless
public had forgotten the crime and its dramatic
sequel, there came a day when Furneaux appeared
at Scotland Yard.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hello, Winter,&quot; he said, coming in as though the
world had grown young again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hello, Furneaux, glad to see you,&quot; said Winter,
pushing the cigar-box across the table.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Had my letter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who has taken my place&mdash;Clarke?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, not Clarke.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nobody, yet. The fact is, Furneaux&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve resigned&mdash;that is the material fact.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I know. But you don&#39;t mind giving me
your advice.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, of course not&mdash;just for the sake of old
times.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, there is this affair of Lady Harringay&#39;s
disappearance. It is a ticklish business. Seen anything
about it in the paper?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A line or two.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m at my wits&#39; end to find time myself to deal
with it. And I&#39;ve not a man I can give it to&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look here, Winter, I&#39;m out of the force.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, to oblige me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I would do a great deal on that score.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>[pg&nbsp;321]</span>
&quot;Get after her, then, without a moment&#39;s delay.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But there&#39;s my resignation.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winter picked a letter from a bundle, struck a
match, set fire to the paper, and lighted a cigar
with it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There goes your resignation!&quot; he said.</p>
<hr />

<p class="indent">During the following summer Rosalind Marsh and
Rupert Osborne were married at Tormouth. It was
a quiet wedding, and since that day they have led
quiet lives, so it is to be presumed that they have
settled satisfactorily the problem of how to be happy
though rich.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
